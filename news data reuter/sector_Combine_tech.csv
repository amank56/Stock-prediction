Walter Isaacson when he asked the Apple Inc cofounder why he authorized a tellall biography after living a private almost ascetic life I wasnt always there for them and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did Jobs told Isaacson in their final interview at Jobs home in Palo Alto California Isaacson said he visited Jobs for the last time a few weeks ago and found him curled up in some pain in a downstairs bedroom Jobs had moved there because he was too weak to go up and down stairs but his mind was still sharp and his humor vibrant Isaacson wrote in an essay on Timecom that will be published in the magazines October 17 edition Jobs died on Wednesday at the age of 56 after a long battle with a rare form of pancreatic cancer Outpourings of sympathy swept across the globe as state leaders business rivals and fans paid respect to the man who touched the daily lives of countless millions through the Macintosh computer iPod iPhone and iPad Jobs had struggled with health issues but said very little about his battle with cancer since an operation in 2004 When he stepped down in August handing the CEO reins to longtime operations chief Tim Cook Jobs said simply that he could no longer fulfill his duties as chief executive Apple has been similarly guarded about the circumstances of his death saying only that their chairman was surrounded by his wife Laurene and immediate family Jobs had four children from two relationships Funeral arrangements have not been disclosed and it is uncertain when the company will hold a planned celebration of Jobs life Officials in Sacramento said there will be no state or public funeral SOMBER MOOD From Tokyo and Paris to San Francisco and New York mourners created impromptu memorials outside Apple stores from flowers and candles to a dozen green and red apples on Manhattans Fifth Avenue At corporate headquarters in the heart of Silicon Valley on Thursday employees  current and former  gathered with their families under an overcast sky to pay their respects at a makeshift memorial on a driveway leading up to the entrance He was a very private person but hes everywhere in the products he created said Glenn Harada a 22yearold former Apple employee He didnt work alone but none of this could have happened without him Employees said they went on with business but with an undercurrent of sadness Grief counselors on the payroll had reached out to Apple workers a spokesman said Deep down theres sadness said Cory Moll a parttime Apple employee who had tried to organize a union We have lost someone who touched us all With his passion for minimalist design and a genius for marketing Jobs laid the groundwork for Apple to continue to flourish after his death most analysts and investors say But Apple

market and there are questions about what Apples next big product will be The launch of the iPhone 4S  at the kind of gala event that became Jobs trademark  was a letdown to many fans earlier this week underscoring how Jobs showmanship and uncanny instincts will be missed But Wall Street analysts said Cooks new teambased approach and operational savvy will keep the company on track  at least for now Apple shares ended down just 023 percent at 37737 though that underperformed the broader US market It didnt come as a shock said Terry Donoghue an Apple technical writer whose department boss called an hourlong meeting to reminisce about Jobs Its still hard for a lot of people JOBS ESTATE CONFIDENTIAL Jobs in his trademark uniform of black mockturtleneck and blue jeans was deemed the heart and soul of a company that rivals Exxon Mobil as the most valuable in America With an estimated net worth of 7 billion  including a 7 percent stake in Walt Disney Co  it was not known how Jobs estate would be handled The entrepreneur had sometimes been criticized for not wielding his enormous influence and wealth for philanthropy like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates His death revived speculation that some of his estate might be donated to cancer research groups or hospitals California law requires a will to be filed in probate court within 30 days of death Jobs and his wife placed at least three properties into trusts in 2009 which legal experts say is a sign he may have been preparing his assets to remain confidential upon his death Placing stock and real estate into trusts can both minimize estate taxes upon a persons death and keep them from being publicly disclosed in probate court said John OGrady a trusts and estates attorney in San Francisco Jobs was given up for adoption soon after his birth in San Francisco to an American mother Joanne Carole Schieble and a Syrianborn father Abdulfattah John Jandali A college dropout Jobs started Apple Computer with friend Steve Wozniak in his parents garage in 1976 I do feel like I did when John Lennon was killed Also JFK and Martin Luther King Like Steve Jobs they gave us hope Wozniak said on his Facebook page Jobs changed the technology world in the late 1970s when the Apple II became the first personal computer to gain a wide following He did it again in 1984 with the Macintosh which built on breakthrough technologies developed at Xerox Parc and elsewhere to create the personal computing experience as we know it today The rebel streak that was central to his persona got him tossed out of Apple in 1985 but he returned in 1997 and after a few years began the rollout of a troika of products  the iPod the iPhone and the iPad  that again upended the established order in major industries Additional reporting by

likely sticking to established battle plans at this critical juncture But longer term he may be better off moving the company out from under Jobs gargantuan shadow The Apple cofounder bequeathed a mystique and cachet to the brand that will be nearimpossible to replace cultivating a community of fans hooked on ease of use and rich content Its those perceptions Cook  who in two months on the job

analysts expect fourthquarter iPhone shipments of as much as 30 million or more almost double from a year ago The fifth iteration of the iconic smartphone comes with a faster processor and a better and more lightsensitive camera but little else to separate it from its predecessor But tech experts say the real gems lie beneath the phones familiar sleek casing Influential reviewers Walt Mossberg and David Pogue raved about Siri  a voicecommand activated assistant that understands and responds to spoken commands and questions in context such as queries about the weather or a friends phone number Pogue called it crazy good transformative categoryredefining speech recognition Despite Siri the iPhone 4S isnt a dramatic gamechanger Some new features are catchups to competitors Mossberg wrote in the Wall Street Journal It isnt perfect and is labeled a beta but it has great potential and worked pretty well for me despite some glitches Both reviewers marveled at Siris ability to hold conversations from basic give me directions to  to quirkier discourses When I asked it Whats the best phone it said Wait  there are other phones Mossberg wrote BLAST FROM THE PAST Cook now faces the monumental task of not only preserving but also advancing Apples lofty status in the industry and among fickle gadget consumers Moreover he must do that while honoring his former boss and mentor a master showman who time and again displayed an uncanny instinct for driving consumer tastes Things for the next two years are pretty much set in stone in terms of what they want to achieve and the new kind of product focus they are putting out After three years the new management is going to make its mark said Jack Salzman principal and founding member of Kings Point Capital Management If there is any pressure on the new Apple management its probably going to be selfimposed because of the void that was left by Steve Jobs The product pipeline is where Cook needs to stamp his own authority on the company He can stick to script only so long before he risks stagnation and damaging the brand Apple needs to find a formula divorced from Jobs persona observers say Indeed during the iPhone 4S media launch last week Cook stepped back and allowed the supporting cast  such as marketing chief Phil Schiller software head Scott Forstall and design guru Jonathan Ive  to tout the device something Jobs would have sought to control from start to finish Theyve got to find a new voice in the market Steve Jobs was so much the face of Apple Calkins said Protect the core elements of the brand but at the same time move forward You cant turn Apple into a memorial for Steve Jobs he added Cook shouldnt be afraid to make changes in the way the company communicates and reaches out to consumers Branding and marketing aside ultimately Apples products  not their hype  need to be judged on their own merits Apples meticulously scripted marketing blasts are the stuff of Silicon Valley legend After rumor and speculation builds across the Internet the company sends out a cryptic email invitation to tease the product That in turn is typically followed by a splashy extravaganza that culminates in a global firstday sales event across the globe that often has people lining up around the block days in advance Past this launch there isnt really a killer new launch I am sure they have got a number of products in development said Pat Becker a portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management But once the phone is out you will have all the price points covered you have got the different carriers covered To me thats a start toward reaching saturation in the phone market Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in New York and Edwin Chan in Los Angeles Editing by  Peter Lauria   Bernard Orr

466,Apple,10/12/2011,Bullish Apple investors start calling for dividend,0, Reuters  Apple Inc is starting to hear a common refrain from investors Show us the money   After the death of chairman and chief innovator Steve Jobs last week investors still like what they see at Apple record demand for the latest iPhone 4S pushed its stock price near an alltime high And it has a cash hoard of 75 billion A Thomson Reuters survey of 11 portfolio managers taken after the news of Jobs death showed strong support for Apples new management team led by Chief Executive Tim Cook and confidence that Apple has at least a few years of great products in development But they also want Apple to start giving up some cash I would opt for a meaningful dividend said Peter Deininger a portfolio manager at Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund one of Apples largest investors Given the magnitude of the cash balance and the ongoing free cash flow generation the company could make a statement about its ability to sustain those flows Deininger added Six of the 11 money managers polled by Reuters called for a dividend payout as a reward for their loyalty  something they fear will be tested as Cook tries to fill Jobs shoes Ten portfolio managers said they still hold Apple stock on faith that Cook will be able to deliver on Jobss vision in the near term But five managers expect investor faith in Apple to be tested in the longer term I worry that Steve was a center of gravity for the company and over time people will say I wanted to work for Steve and go and do something else said David Eiswert of T Rowe Price That will be something to watch over the next year or two Apple has long resisted a dividend It has put its money toward internal product development made the rare acquisition  and built its cash stockpile which now accounts for about a fifth of its value Apples market cap soared to just shy of 349 billion when Jobs stepped down in August from 5 billion when he returned to the company in 1997 That unusual torrid growth in a large company has one money manager in the survey bracing for an eventual slowdown We havent seen a company this size grow so it has to decelerate said Richard Sheiner of Geneva Advisors So far investors are sticking with the company The creative talent at Apple is broad and deep and it has established a brand moat with the consumer said Nigel Holland who helps manage 565 billion at Legal  General Investment Management And thats a big reason why three of the managers surveyed said they have bought up all the Apple shares they are allowed to Theres every reason to own Apple stock and we are committed to owning it over the next couple of years said Keith Wirtz chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management Bruce Olson coportfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Advantage Growth Fund agreed The coast is pretty clear for them for the next five years he said Beyond the short term however some shareholders are worried about whether Apple can continue to push out innovative gadgets after the product pipeline Jobs left behind is tapped out If we saw a slowdown on product launches and developments that would give us some pause Less people camping out for a few days to get the new product  that would be symptomatic of it losing its touch Wirtz said One fund manager polled is not waiting around for Apple to fall from grace We dont have shares in Apple said Kim Caughey Forrest vice president and senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group Jobs death contributed to the skepticism but it is also the closed environment of selling hardware and software together that works extremely well for consumers but not so well for business Reporting by  Edward Krudy  Sam Forgione and Supantha Mukherjee in New York Editing by Edward Tobin and  Matthew Lewis ,58.19142900000001,55.271427

469,Apple,10/18/2011,Apple blames iPhone rumors for disappointing results,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc stunned Wall Street by reporting results that missed expectations for the first time in years blaming rumors of the new iPhone for hurting demand in the September quarter   Shares of Apple fell 7 percent in extended trading on Tuesday wiping some 27 billion off the value of the worlds largest technology company It was Apples first quarterly earnings under Chief Executive Tim Cook who took over from Steve Jobs in August at a critical juncture for the company Apple is battling Google Inc in the mobile arena as well as other challengers such as Samsung and Amazoncom Inc Investors are going to start to speculate that there is change under way now that Jobs is gone and that theres trouble ahead We dont share that point said Channing Smith comanager at Capital Advisors Growth Fund which holds Apple shares The iPhone is where the weakness was and its an explainable one The strong demand for the iPhone 4S set up strong demand for the holiday season Apple said it sold 1707 million iPhones in its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 24  well short of the roughly 20 million forecast by analysts The iPhone is Apples flagship product yielding some 40 percent of annual sales Revenue rose 39 percent to 2827 billion lower than the average analyst estimate of 2969 billion according to Thomson Reuters IBES It was the first time Apple missed revenue expectations since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008 Net profit was 662 billion or 705 a share That fell shy of expectations for earnings of 739 per share The last time Apple missed EPS estimates was in the first quarter of 2001 according to Thomson Reuters IBES Expectations for this company were redhot that is why we downgraded it said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis who lowered his rating on the shares days before The reality is their business is not an annuity They have to sell their quarters worth of revenue every 90 days They had a big upgrade cycle with the iPhone the numbers came in weak They need to set records every time they report to keep up the momentum Apple executives said consumers had postponed purchase decisions until the crucial holiday quarter because of speculation that a new phone was on the way Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S in early October and it hit stores last Friday Apple  which typically offers projections so conservative they are disregarded  on Tuesday forecast December quarter revenue and earnings above Wall Streets estimates Theres no question this was a transition quarter ahead of the 4S said WP Stewart portfolio manager Michael Walker With the early pace of iPhone 4S sales my guess is that disappointment is relatively shortlived Im not going to call Q3 a throwaway quarter for iPhones but it was definitely a transition A PERIOD OF TRANSITION Cook started his first earnings conference call as CEO by honoring Jobs who died on October 5 after a yearslong battle against pancreatic cancer He said he was very confident of posting record iPhone sales in the current quarter The company moved 4 million iPhone 4S units  more than double its predecessor  in its first three days despite lukewarm reviews Another area for optimism for Apple was iPads The company moved 1112 million units during the quarter despite attempts by various manufacturers including Samsung to capture a slice of the tablet market Now Amazoncom has also entered the fray with its Kindle Fire tablet Acknowledging the competition Cook said it was reasonable to say none of Apples rivals have gained any traction and he expected the tablet market to be bigger than personal computer in the long term Cook also told analysts that Greater China  mainland China Hong Kong and Taiwan  was becoming an allimportant region for Apple as it has quickly become No 2 on our list of top revenue countries very very quickly Revenue from the region increased fourfold to 45 billion during the quarter The new CEO fielded questions on Apples cash pile of over 81 billion saying the money provided flexibility for acquisitions and investing in the supply chain That said Im not religious about holding cash or not holding it he added Its a topic for the board on an ongoing basis Apples Mac sales saw a large spike during the September quarter but it failed to lift earnings Apple sold 489 million Macs up 27 percent from a year ago Gross margin came to 403 percent  a tad higher than Wall Streets forecast of 3974 percent International sales accounted for 63 percent of the quarters revenue We expected iPhone sales to decline in the September quarter from the June quarter as a result of the announcements we made  in June where we said we would launch iOS 5 and iCloud in fall Peter Oppenheimer Chief Financial Officer said in an interview with Reuters That basically created the rumor of the day across the September quarter especially at the end Apple said it expected December quarter earnings of 930 a share on revenue of about 37 billion Wall Street is projecting 901 for the period but it was unclear if that was comparable What is interesting is the guidance is less conservative than usual for their next quarter Its a timing issue where it looks like the business that people thought would be in the September quarter is occurring in the December quarter said

483,Apple,1/13/2012,Apple reveals supply chain details conditions,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple revealed its closely guarded list of global suppliers for the first time and vowed to deal with worker abuses hoping to deflect criticism it was turning a blind eye to cases of poor working conditions in a mostly Asian supply chain   The dramatic and unprecedented step  unveiling the names of 156 companies that represent 97 percent of the companys supply chain  was an unusual move in an industry that relies heavily on foreign component suppliers to drive margins It is rarer still for a notoriously secretive company underscoring speculation that new Chief Executive Tim Cook has ushered in an era of greater transparency Predecessor Steve Jobs who died in October kept an iron grip on the internal workings of the company he founded and turned into the worlds largest technology company The tellall on Friday surprised many in the industry and on Wall Street Experts say rivals and investors pay consultants for exactly this type of valuable intelligence Apples list is the culmination of internal probes into its supply chain spanning hundreds of audits over years and highprofile firms from Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd to Samsung Foxconn in particular has dragged Apple into headlines after a spate of worker suicides raised questions about conditions at its Chinese plants Apple said it found six active and 13 historical cases of underage labor at some component suppliers but none at its finalassembly partners With every year we expand our program we go deeper in our supply chain we make it harder to comply Cook told Reuters in an interview All of this means that workers will be treated better and better with each passing year Its not something we feel like we have done what we can do much remains to be done The audit conducted by Apple of suppliers found a number of violations among them breaches in pay benefits and environmental practices in plants in China which figured prominently throughout the 500page report Apple issued Other violations unearthed included dumping wastewater onto a neighboring farm using machines without safeguards testing workers for pregnancy and falsifying pay records Apple did not identify the facilities where it found violations ABOLISHING UNDERAGE LABOR Apple said it conducted 229 audits last year representing an 80 percent increase over 2010 From 2007 to 2010 the company conducted only 288 total audits It looked at all levels of its supply chain including final assembly and component suppliers I would like to make a significant improvement in the overtime area I would like to totally eliminate every case of underage employment said Cook We have done that in all of our final assembly As we go deeper into the supply chain we found that age verification system isnt sophisticated enough This is something we feel very strongly about and we want to eliminate totally Apple said it will grant access to an independent auditing team from the Fair Labor Association in its continuing effort to overcome criticism regarding working conditions at its supply factories It also terminated business with one unidentified supplier and was correcting the practices of another Both were repeat offenders the report said Apples audit found out that only 38 percent of suppliers adhered to its code of a maximum work week of 60 hours Also foreign contract workers in 15 facilities paid excessive recruitment fees to labor agencies the report said Apple leans heavily on its suppliers and often gets first priority in production and delivery Its influence might have helped make possible its yearslong audits And it will prove crucial as Apple prepares to drive its producers to begin work on new products in 2012 starting with the iPad 3 expected in the first quarter MODEL CORPORATE CITIZEN Labor experts said Apples efforts may spur other corporations to seek to address labor conditions within an often murky and foreign production chain  a continual source of outrage both at home and elsewhere in the developed world Apple has made major efforts to improve and communicate its policies following highprofile labor problems at its foreign suppliers and manufacturers including at Foxconn The suicides at the plants associated with Apple cast a harsh spotlight on what critics dubbed a militaristic culture that pushed workers to the brink to meet unceasing demand for the company In response Apple stepped up the number of facilities it audits to ensure they meet its code of conduct The increased scope of Apples report this year follows the enactment of a new law in California requiring retailers and manufacturers to disclose how they guard against slavery and human trafficking throughout their supply chains Apples steppedup audits and its extensive social responsibility reports more than meet the new laws disclosure requirements lawyers say But the new legislation may have had the indirect effect of raising the bar for Apple and other companies that want to show their customers they care how suppliers treat their employees They begin to think about how can we be seen as real leaders on these issues If everyone is on a level playing field because of the new regulation in terms of disclosure what we can do is to separate ourselves and begin to raise the bar even further

489,Apple,1/26/2012,Apple CEO faces first test with cash mountain,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple CEO Tim Cook has a problem a 98 billion problem   Just 18 months ago Apples 46 billion mountain of cash  while huge by most standards  attracted only muted complaints from investors who did call for a dividend or share buyback but were mostly happy with the meteoric rise in the stock price But with the growing cash balance now a much bigger overhang on the stock widely considered to be undervalued investors are clamoring more vocally for Cook to put the money to work No one could have foreseen just how quickly that warchest would grow Indeed some analysts estimated Apples cash holdings would increase to 65 billion at the end of 201l That it has swelled nearly 50 percent above even those lofty projections is nothing short of awesome Apple now has about 104 in cash per share But to paraphrase rapper P Diddy with more money comes more problems Apples runaway success presents Cook with his first real public test as chief executive officer  figuring out what to do with the money Apples cash balance is now a quarter of its 415 billion market capitalization and roughly equals Californias 20122013 state budget And even though 64 billion of Apples cash is overseas  meaning it will have to pay a hefty tax to bring it into the United States  calls for a dividend on Wall Street grew louder after the company said on Tuesday it was in active discussions internally on what to do with the money Wall Street is strongly in favor of Apple returning the money to shareholders through buybacks or dividends even if it is only a onetime deal But the ultraconservative company which typically ignores Wall Street gave no clues about that during its earnings call on Tuesday They are clearly trying to signal that they are not ignoring the issue said Michael Holt an analyst with Morningstar It doesnt mean that a decision is imminent Others however are convinced a dividend will be paid this year With Apple stating that it is actively pursuing its options with regards to its cash balance we believe the commentary may be setting itself up for a cash dividend in FY12 Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White said raising his target on the stock to 666 Katy Huberty an analyst with Morgan Stanley echoed Whites view saying Apple appears committed to making a decision on cash return in the nearterm and we continue to believe a dividend makes the most sense Some big technology companies have started paying a dividend to help allay investor concerns about slowing growth by returning part of their ample cash holdings Cisco Systems Inc began paying a dividend last year while Microsoft Corp started in 2003 FAR TOO MUCH MONEY Apple stock gained 25 percent in 2011 adding about 77 billion to its market cap and it touched an alltime high of 45445 on Wednesday Some continue to bank on a shareprice rise to as high as 700 The companys core business is throwing off massive amounts of cash every quarter  Apple recorded a 16 billion increase in cash sequentially  in part because of its reluctance to pay a dividend or buy back stock and its limited acquisition history The company earned a mere 077 percent on its cash and investments in fiscal 2011 mostly due to its preference for safe but lowyielding US Treasury and agency debt This is a tad higher than the 075 percent it earned in fiscal 2010 but down from 143 percent in fiscal 2009 344 percent in 2008 and 527 percent in 2007 Fiscal prudence has long been part of Apples mantra and the Cupertino Californiabased company runs a tight ship with total revenue rising 66 percent in fiscal 2011 but operating expenses rising only 37 percent For now Apples Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer has veered away from his usual script which was to tell Wall Street that Apple has always had internal discussions on the best use of its cash with capital preservation being key He characterized these discussion as active on Tuesday We recognize that the cash is growing for all the right reasons Oppenheimer said but added he had nothing to announce In the meantime were not letting it burn a hole in our pockets Oppenheimer also suggested that Apple might invest in its supply chain or make acquisitions But Apple has typically preferred to acquire small companies which has had little or no material impact on its results so far Apples major expense last year was paying the lions share to acquire  along with Microsoft and a few other companies  the patent portfolio of bankrupt telecommunications company Nortel for 45 billion Apple said it spent 43 billion in fiscal 2011 to acquire property plant and equipment 32 billion in acquisition of intangible assets and 244 million in payments made in connection with business acquisitions according to its annual regulatory filing That is in sharp contrast to rivals such as Google Inc which is acquiring Motorola Mobility for 125 billion in cash and which completed 54 acquisitions during the first nine months of last year alone The companys 446 billion warchest of cash and investments at the end of December was far lower than Apples Google has also resisted pressure to announce a dividend or buy back stock Apple may do the same in the next few months said Michael Walkley an analyst with Canaccord Genuity We believe Apple is likely to announce a dividend during 2012 potentially next quarter when crossing 100 billion in cash and cash equivalents Walkley said We view this as very bullish for investors as we believe a new group of investors seeking dividends would invest in Apple and drive shares higher Reporting By Poornima Gupta editing by  Andre Grenon ,64.05143000000001,53.388573
490,Apple,1/26/2012,How to play it: The anti-contrarian on Apple's high,0, NEW YORK  Reuters  Apples first quarter in the postSteve Jobs era was a success   Apple reported that it sold more than 37 million iPhones and some 155 million iPads during its last quarter after the market closed Tuesday Its shares jumped more than 6 percent and hit an alltime high Wednesday leapfrogging Apple past Exxon Mobil to once again become the most valuable company in the world In what seems to be a quarterly routine analysts scrambled to raise their target prices for the company following its earnings announcement Among the highest target 670 50 percent above its Tuesday close A stock as popular with investors as Apple typically has contrarians pointing to signs of trouble But there are several reasons why simple contrarianism might not pan out this time GO TO THE SOURCE The best way to play Apples earnings Buy Apple Despite gaining more than 25 percent over the last year Apple still looks like a value stock to many investors The stock is cheaper now than the day I bought it said Stephen Coleman head of St Louisbased Daedalus Capital Coleman began buying Apple at 1120 in February 2004 he said Since then hes notched a 3888 percent gain Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 12 The broad Standard  Poors 500 index meanwhile trades a PE multiple of about 13 By comparison Amazoncom Apples most direct competitor in the tablet market trades at a PE of 98 The company is trading at a discount according to other metrics as well Based on its growth rate the companys intrinsic value is 53340 per share a nearly 20 percent jump from its current share price of 44666 according to Starmine Its gross margins increased 44 percent from the prior quarter according to Michael Holt an analyst at Morningstar Why arent Apple shares trading higher The market appears to be discounting Apples ability to maintain its earnings growth now that it has a dominant position in the smartphone and tablet markets analysts said The companys forward price to earnings ratio is now just 111 times future earnings according to Starmine High forward PEs typically imply that investors expect earnings growth to accelerate In 2003 for instance the company traded at a forward PE ratio of 80 after introducing the iPod some two years earlier according to Starmine Apple also has nearly 100 billion in cash on its balance sheet Possible options for that staggering sum is something that the company is actively discussing said Peter Oppenheimer Apples CFO on its earnings call The companys cash pile equates to 103 per share noted T Michael Walkley an analyst at Canaccord Genuity With Apple expected to cross 100 billion in cash during the March quarter we believe this milestone might push Apple to announce a dividend he wrote in a note to clients Investors may be reluctant to buy any stock hitting an alltime high The 430 region was formerly resistance on Apple but with the huge gap up after earnings on Wednesday that level now becomes very strong support said Gareth Feighery a founder of options education firm MarketTamercom in Philadelphia Feighery suggests a strategy that sees limited downside and risk for Apple shares with a socalled February 430420 bull put spread  buying the lower strike put and selling the higher strike put This trade essentially allows an investor to profit from the spread as long as shares dont fall below 430 The spread involves the sale of the 430 strike put to finance the purchase of the 420 strike put to collect a premium of 139 The strategy offers a risk return of 161 percent based on the shares trading at 448 The danger is if shares fall below 430 and if assigned the investor would be obligated to buy the stock at 430 The purpose of the 420 put purchase is to limit risk if the shares were to drop precipitously and offers protection Feighery said Equity put options convey the right to sell shares at a preset price any time up until expiration and are often used by investors to insure their long stock positions against a potential decline in shares LOOK OVERSEAS With its roles as both manufacturer and increasingly

492,Apple,2/3/2012,Wall Street analysts struggle to predict Apple,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  By day Robert Leitao manages a Catholic church in Southern California By night he indulges his other passion predicting Apple Incs  AAPLO  results   Leitao is part of a cadre of amateur forecasters bloggers and hobbyists who sift through reams of data every quarter to guess at Apples quarterly results  often putting professional analysts to shame by coming up with more accurate predictions Cofounder of the Apple Independent Analysts Group Leitao is ranked seventh for the December quarter out of 50 analysts who cover Apple by Fortune magazine which found that his estimates turned out to be much closer to the results than those from prestigious banks such as Goldman Sachs  GSN  and Morgan Stanley  MSN  While Wall Street analysts forecasts for Apples revenue and earnings per share were off by an average of 21 percent in the latest quarter amateur analysts missed by just 10 percent according to the Fortune data This raises questions about how good Wall Street is at forecasting Apple the largest US company by market value famous for trouncing market forecasts quarter after quarter Leitao does not believe he and the more than 100 members of the Apple Independent Analysts Group  which he started as a hobby  are smarter than their professional peers He suspects Wall Street is more inclined to play it safe It does not help that Apple itself tends to lowball its guidance In their work there is a greater risk in coming out with aggressive estimates that are too high Leitao said of analysts at toptier brokerage firms In the last couple of years Apples earnings have exceeded Wall Street expectations tracked by Thomson Reuters IBES by at least 13 percent and often a lot more The exception was the September quarter of 2011 when they fell short Technology analysts say Apple is particularly tough to predict because of its secretive nature and because it has a hand in everything from hardware iPhones iPads Macs and iPods to digital distribution iTunes and its emerging iCloud remote storage service They also point to a lack of historical data on the tablet market and Apples fast expansion into more than 100 countries as challenges Yet another blind spot is sales from Apples own retail stores and applecom  data that only the company has If youre talking about Apple where youre trying to model Macs and phones and new markets like tablets thats obviously more challenging than making assumptions around Intel where youre only modeling PCs said JMP analyst Alex Gauna WALL OF SILENCE Analysts refine their financial models by studying Asian companies that supply components to Apple surveying retail executives and extrapolating from sales of previous generations of iPhones and iPads Their counterparts covering Intel Corp  INTCO  and other big tech companies regularly visit PC manufacturers in Asia to take the industrys temperature But attempts to talk to Apples more than 100 suppliers including Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd  2317TW  often run into a wall of silence Beyond normal US Regulation Fair Disclosure rules governing the disclosure of material information companies working for Apple are required to sign strict confidentiality agreements and risk losing Apples business if they break them That rigor stems from the era

Looking for an edge analysts resort to visiting Apple stores on important productlaunch dates to count heads and conduct surveys But they acknowledge the data is not enough to draw firm conclusions You try to build a mosaic said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu Thats the best you can do Another problem is the growing impact from Apples new product launches which can skew sales as consumers hold off on purchasing older products in anticipation of newer models That happened in the September quarter when Apples results missed for the first time in four years due to slowerthanexpected smartphone sales ahead of the iPhone 4S launch The company then saw a huge spurt in iPhone sales in the December quarter Apple has historically been very conservative in giving guidance usually handing out estimates far below Street projections In 2011 Apple underestimated its own revenue by an average of 16 percent each quarter The company wants to keep expectations low and outperform as the quarter goes out said Brian Marshall analyst with ISI Group There are signs of change however In the past two quarters Chief Executive Tim Cook actually forecast revenue and earnings per share at or above Wall Street estimates Analysts hope this heralds a more predictable era under Cook Theyre becoming a little more transparent Itll make it easier for people to understand the story said Sterne Agees Wu

500,Apple,3/6/2012,"In China Apple faces its ""Nike moment""?",1, BEIJING  Reuters  As Apple Inc the worlds most valuable listed company braces itself for a report into alleged poor working conditions among its army of lowcost suppliers in China it could heed the lessons from another bigbrand retailer that faced similar issues two decades ago   Apple is facing its Nike moment said Teresa Cheng international campaign coordinator for United Students Against Sweatshops USAS referring to accusations in the 1990s that suppliers to sportswear retailer Nike Inc mistreated workers Such is the Californiabased iPad and iPhone makers dominance of the technology sector that its response to the nonprofit Fair Labor Associations FLA report  expected this week  could affect conditions across Chinas vast electronics supply chain Nike was battered in the media and by public opinion because its suppliers in Asia forced employees to work long hours without breaks and paid them a pittance without benefits The companys response  and what some say are the mistakes it made  could offer a roadmap for Apple which has faced similar bad press following deaths and reports of suicides at its China supply firms Three workers at Foxconn Technology Co Ltd died in a blast last year when dust from polishing iPads ignited and labor rights groups have said 18 workers at Foxconn sites killed themselves or tried to in 2010 The vast majority of Foxconns 12 million employees are involved in assembling Apple products according to media reports Apple hired teams from the FLA to interview 35000 workers at three of Foxconns sprawling factories which put together iPads and iPhones as well as gadgets for other wellknown brands The FLAs interim report into Apples suppliers based on those anonymous interviews over the past three weeks could mirror a number of the issues that Nike faced Trouble in your supply chain can really hurt your reputation globally extremely rapidly said Kenneth Lieberthal director of the Brookings Institutions China center and author of Managing the China Challenge How to Achieve Corporate Success in the Peoples Republic The wisdom in the industry from that Nike experience is that you have to do a lot of work to be sure you understand what is happening in your supply chain In the early 1990s when media and activists began reporting on conditions at Nikes suppliers in Asia and central America the company brought in wideranging reforms designed to eradicate worker maltreatment and later opened those operations to inspection It wrote a code of conduct for contractors requiring them to provide workplaces free of harassment and abuse Contractors cannot employ underage workers must pay at least the minimum wage and provide a clear accounting in writing for every pay period with no deductions for disciplinary infractions Rules also govern overtime and days off Nike also engaged its critics The most significant shift for Nike was when we began to sit down with the very people who had been critical of us and started to engage not in a denial conversation but in a conversation on how to solve the problems said Hannah Jones Nikes vice president of sustainable business and innovation But some problems and criticism persist Last year one of Nikes contractors in Indonesia agreed to pay more than 4400 workers 1 million after complaints they were forced to work overtime without payment When problems are identified they are addressed said Jones Some problems however can slip through We dont have loopholes in our processes but youre talking about 1000 or so factories just for Nike in 52 countries with about 1 million workers in them Jones said in an interview this week TAKING A PAGE FROM NIKE By hiring the FLA to inspect its factories Apple is taking a leaf from Nikes book Such monitoring however should only be a first step said Richard Locke head of the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has researched the supply chains of Nike and Apple rival HewlettPackard Auditing assumes the problem is that there are bad managers who need to be policed more frequently which is generally not the case said Locke Instead the problem is staff insufficiently trained to run complex operations and brands and retailers making unreasonable demands of suppliers Where you see suppliers  working with the brands you see both improvements on the business side and improvements on the labor side he said Suddenly you dont need excess overtime because youre running a good operation Your margins are higher and you can afford to pay people a little better Foxconn has said it was raising salaries by 1625 percent and last month was advertising a basic monthly wage not including overtime of 1800 yuan 290 in Shenzhen Guangdong province  where the monthly minimum wage is 1500 yuan Apple stresses its partners are required to adhere to strict global standards We insist our suppliers provide safe working conditions and treat workers with dignity and respect said spokeswoman Carolyn Wu Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple But if Nikes experience is any guide Apple can expect close scrutiny for years to come Unless we hold Apples feet to the fire theyre going to get away with profiting off the same sweatshop conditions and driving a global race to the bottom while fooling the public and making it look like theyre getting better just like Nike did Cheng at USAS said in emailed comments The Nike

501,Apple,3/6/2012,Apple's next iPad may be a 4G game changer,1, SAN FRANCISCONEW YORK  Reuters  Apple Inc is betting a 4Gequipped iPad will tempt more US consumers to pay extra to watch highquality video on the go and in turn give Verizon Wireless and ATT Inc a revenue boost   Until now Apples fan legion has been reluctant to shell out extra money even for iPads with 3G connections The cheaper WiFionly model  with more limited Web access  is by far the topselling one today The newest iPad will be capable of operating on a highspeed 4G LTE or LongTerm Evolution network according to a source familiar with the product At speeds roughly 10 times faster than current 3G technology that may go a long way toward banishing the sometimes shaky video quality of older devices Such a juicedup device would help boost the telecoms market if consumers catch on and can be enticed to pay more some analysts said The global tablet user base already reached 67 million in 2011 according to researcher Strategy Analytics Its going to dramatically improve video consumption said UBS analyst John Hodulik This is the device people want They want the fastest speed They want high resolution Apple ATT and Verizon declined to comment The Cupertino Californiabased consumer device company is gearing up to unveil the iPad 3 on Wednesday a faster and betterequipped version intended to thwart increasing competition from rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co and Amazoncom The new iPad will be critical to Apple if it is to continue to dominate the global tablet market said Frost  Sullivans analyst Phil Harpur A lot will depend how receptive the market is to the new features offered by iPad 3 two of which are believed to be quadcore processing and 4GLTE capabilities he said While iPad 2 offered only minor incremental upgrades this time the market will be expecting a lot more The unveiling at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco where the company also introduced the last two iPad generations will be Chief Executive Tim Cooks second major product launch after the iPhone 4S unveiling last year at the companys headquarters The smartphone was initially a disappointment as it was perceived to be mostly a software upgrade but Siri its voiceenabled personal assistant technology helped to make it a bestseller Cook will again be flanked by Apples top cadres on Wednesday when he kicks off a typically tightly choreographed show scrutinized by investors and industry insiders On hand will likely be Apples top marketing executive Phil Schiller its head of Internet services Eddy Cue and software chief Scott Forstall  the standard cast for major launches following the death of founder and consummate showman Steve Jobs last year UPGRADE TO APPLE TV IN WORKS The company legendary for keeping its agenda under wraps has not said what it plans to reveal but invited speculation with its cryptic event invitation graced by a partial image of an iPad screen and the tagline We have something you really have to see And touch Some predict an upgrade of the Apple TV one of the rare company products that has not seen mass adoption Jefferies analyst Peter Misek said the see and touch reference was very curious An upgrade of the Apple TV settopbox is possible as well as a remote chance for an iTV television set due to a reference to a large screen size Misek said in a note to clients adding that it was possible that Apple could also announce an actual TV despite not having a finished product Until then it is the iPad 3s 4G capabilities that may be commanding the firmest speculation iPad sales doubled in the December quarter to 1543 million units The company has sold about 55 million iPads since it was introduced in 2010 and recorded more than 20 billion in sales and related services and accessories in fiscal 2011 But dozens of new devices are set to launch this year so Apple needs to stay a step ahead of its deeppocketed rivals Handset makers including Samsung and Motorola Mobility already have LTEcapable tablets available so in a way Apple is already late to the game The Samsung and Motorola tablets run on Google Incs Android software which is fast gaining ground on Apples iOS Market share of Androidbased tablets in the fourth quarter rose to 39 percent from 29 percent a year ago while the iPads market share slipped to 58 percent from 68 percent according to Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston But the early highspeed tablets have not caught on They accounted for a mere 1 percent of total tablet sales in 2011 partly because they were expensive Mawston said While Apple is not breaking new ground with LTE it may play a big hand in the technologys take off on tablets because of the popularity of its iPad platform The iPad 3 may also be helped by recent expansion in the availability of LTE services according to Mawston Both Verizon and ATT have been upgrading their networks with LTE but since Verizon Wireless had a head start in rolling out LTE  its first markets came on line in late 2010  it should have an advantage over ATT which launched its first LTE markets last Summer Verizons LTE network covers markets with a population of 200 million while ATTs covers 74 million Sprint Nextel the No 3 US operator will offer LTE later this year One impediment to the success of the iPad 3 with the faster connectivity could be rising data service charges Carriers charge customers for data on a perusage basis which can quickly add up For example watching 30 minutes of video a day on Verizon could add up to almost twice as much data downloads as its monthly 30 service package provides for If people really like how the new device works UBSs Hodulik said they may not mind the charges Even if only 10 percent more iPad users bought the 4G instead of the WiFi version it would help service providers which do not subsidize the price of the iPad Macquarie analyst Kevin Smithen said Generally it should be incremental revenue for the carriers Smithen said So far the most popular version of the current iPad is the cheapest  the one that works only on WiFi a shortrange wireless connection and does not connect to service providers networks So it could still be an uphill task to convince most buyers to pay for iPad services even with faster speeds Its very important for a decent size subset of the users

503,Apple,3/7/2012,Apple lifts lid on 4G iPad keeps prices,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc took the wraps off a faster 4Gequipped iPad starting at 629 hoping the latest version of its tablet can safeguard its dominance over rivals ranging from Amazoncom Inc to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   Chief Executive Tim Cook presiding over his second major product launch after debuting with 2011s voiceenabled iPhone 4S introduced the highly anticipated third iteration of the tablet which is available for preorders from Wednesday and will hit store shelves March 16 The highend model of Apples latest iPad will be capable of operating on a highspeed 4G LTE or LongTerm Evolution network At speeds roughly 10 times faster than current 3G technology that may help banish the sometimes shaky video quality of older devices Wall Street had anticipated many of the features Cook showed off on Wednesday including a higherdefinition retina display screen  containing several times as many pixels within the same area  and a better camera Shares of Apple closed barely higher up 43 cents at 53069 They hovered around 530 throughout the unveiling event which was attended by Marc Benioff CEO of enterprise cloud computing company Salesforcecom Inc Jeremy Stoppelman CEO of online business review site Yelp Inc and influential venturecapitalist John Doerr among other industry luminaries Some had held out hope of a positive Apple surprise recalling late CEO Steve Jobs and his nowiconic one more thing unveils at the very end of the such announcements Others said the upgrades and tweaks to the iPad could only go so far in fending off hardcharging competition While the hardware is notably enhanced with an impressive retina display better camera and faster processor there are still some areas of improvement that Apple needs to work on in order to stay ahead of its encroaching competitors said Fred Huet managing partner at Greenwich Consulting As tablets are increasingly being used for personal media consumption it is promising to see a better screen resolution But will this be enough to ensure Apples competitive lead in the marketplace No Others say Apple is betting a 4Gequipped iPad will tempt more US consumers to pay for higherquality video on the go That in turn should give Verizon Wireless and ATT Inc a revenue boost analysts say Verizon Wireless a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc and ATT will host and sell 4G wireless plans to 4G iPad users Until now buyers have been reluctant to shell out extra cash even for iPads with slower 3G connections The cheaper WiFionly model with much more limited Web access is by far Apples topselling one today An updated version of the WiFionly model remains at 499 The most expensive 4G model with 64 gigabytes of storage will go for 829 The previous iPad2 with 3G also sold for 629 to 829 The cheapest model of the previousgeneration iPad 2 now retails at 399 The iPhone 4S showed us that Apple doesnt need to outdo itself with new product designs to continue extending its domination of a category said CCS Insight analyst John Jackson THE LATEST IPAD In an apparent departure from naming conventions Apples thirdgeneration tablet will not be called the iPad 3 but simply referred to as the latest iPad a small point that several analysts and executives noticed and pointed out Regardless of the name the company is counting on a warm reception to its latest tablet to fend off an increasingly aggressive challenge from tablets powered by Google Incs Android technology with Microsoft Corp softwaredriven devices slated to come soon Everyones been wondering who will come out with a product thats more amazing than the iPad 2 Cook said Stop wondering We are Earlier in the proceedings Cook again held forth on what he called a postPC world in which users move increasingly away from traditional desktop and laptop computing and toward an array of portable devices including tablets Smartphones and tablets are starting to eat into PC sales as mobile technology gets more advanced and available content expands Some experts believe mobile devices as they get more powerful will eventually displace PCs in many markets hurting business for the likes of HewlettPackard Co and Dell Inc The global tablet user base reached 67 million in 2011 according to researcher Strategy Analytics Analysts expect doubledigit growth in tablet sales in coming years Cook also announced that the companys new 99 Apple TV settop box a concept that late CEO Steve Jobs had called a hobby now supports highdefinition 1080p screen technology Last year alone we sold 172 million postPC devices Cook told the audience at the Yerba Buena Center in downtown San Francisco Apples preferred venue for product unveilings And this made up 76 percent of our revenues This is incredible Cooks performance was again the subject of scrutiny The CEO replaced famed showman Jobs after the cofounders October death and has since drawn several comparisons in terms of onstage charisma Some in Wednesdays audience found the event wanting This iPad 3 launch is horribly boring Steve I miss you terribly

504,Apple,3/7/2012,Instant view: Apple unveils more powerful high-def iPad,0, Reuters  Apple Inc unveiled an upgraded version of its popular iPad tablet on Wednesday featuring a more powerful chip highdefinition screen sharper camera and access to new highspeed wireless networks   The upgrades were broadly expected Apples shares fell after the announcement trading down 06 percent on Nasdaq The following are instant reactions from investors and analysts MICHAEL HOLT ANALYST MORNINGSTAR They want you to think of it as the iPad not which model its an interesting choice People who are into bragging rights would have liked to say this is the iPad 3 The screen is a notable feature for a nontechie customers as is the faster connectivity Thats something that mainstream consumers can identify with Theres pentup demand because a new device was widely anticipated Theyve made enough incremental improvements to do well If you look at people whove opened their mind to tablet ownership in the last three to six months they were probably hesitant to buy one knowing this was around the corner This releases that pentup demand People already have a broadband plan in their house and then they have a smartphone How many data plans do individuals want to have SHAW WU ANALYST STERNE AGEE We view the new iPads features as quite compelling for both existing users and new users particularly the much faster 4G LTE wireless capability On stock dip It is likely some profit taking as the stock has climbed a bit into the event There are shortterm traders who sell on the news MICHAEL YOSHIKAMI CEO DESTINATION WEALTH MANAGEMENT The first thing that jumps out is the pricing which is typical of Apple They are keeping the same pricing and adding more memory I expect the iPad 2 will be discounted down after all this The resolution of the camera is quite important because this will allow for streaming and video at higher quality The processor is so much speedier Thats going to allow game makers to develop a much richer experience Thats a negative for game console makers like Nintendo Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox iPad games are cheaper and developers have to share a higher margin with Apple There will be margin compression among game console makers because of this I think the stock advances from here This is more good news and there are more products coming out later this year I see little evidence yet from todays event about an integrated TV offering But Apple will move towards TV in the same way they conquered music  by getting people connected to devices and then supplying content through these devices HENDI SUSANTO ANALYST GABELLI  CO The iPad 3 is definitely the strong tablet offering in the market I would expect strong growth of iPad sales to continue Now that Apple has adapted 4G on its iPad I think a 4G iPhone is next Now that the iPad 3 has a highresolution retina display that could cost more so the iPad 3 may have a lower margin compared to the iPad 3 But considering the iPad will continue to have strong growth based on the whole picture while it may carry a lower margin it will still generate more dollars FRED HUET MANAGING DIRECTOR GREENWICH CONSULTING Nobody was expecting a drastic upgrade although there were the usual rumors of the iPad mini However this is a solid device that will no doubt sell well for anybody hoping to upgrade or others who have seen the tablet market mature and are looking to dip their toes in Yet while the hardware is notably enhanced with an impressive retina display better camera and faster processor there are still some areas of improvement that Apple needs to work on in order to stay ahead of its encroaching competitors As tablets are increasingly being used for personal media consumption it is promising to see a better screen resolution but will this be enough to ensure Apples competitive lead in the marketplace No According to recent Forrester research one third of US adults will own a tablet by 2016 Though a direct competitor for the iPad hasnt yet emerged price point will doubtless have a part to play and the various Android tablets now on sale have excellent capabilities as we saw at MWC Mobile World Congress last week COLIN GILLIS ANALYST BGC FINANCIAL No surprises no fireworks Quad core retina display 4G and the pricing strategy is the same What we really want to see is what happens with the iPad 2 what price point do they drop that to The stock is flat to slightly down and were starting to see selling on the news JOHN JACKSON ANALYST CCS INSIGHT The iPhone 4S showed us that Apple doesnt need to outdo itself with new product designs to continue extending its domination of a category The new iPad adds about a millimeter of thickness and a little weight over the iPad 2 This is likely attributable to the new screen andor a bigger battery needed to power it There is some risk that that consumers will perceive the difference in thickness and weight and opt for the older version instead of the new especially if the older one is cheaper Apple is banking on a screen that will clearly pop at retail Reporting By  Noel Randewich   Tarmo

to get hold of a 4Gready tablet computer that won good reviews despite stopping short of being called a major innovation   Carrier Telstra stole a march on Apple commencing sales at just two of its own stores at midnight Numbers were down compared with previous launches though a stillsolid turnout reflected demand for a new iPad version deemed a collection of incremental improvements Apple shares breached 600 for the first time on Thursday on the Nasdaq but gave up gains and dipped into the red in the afternoon The stock is up 47 percent for the year and nearly 10 percent for the month partly on anticipation for the new device A single Apple share now costs more than the WiFionly iPad which is priced starting at 499 The initial rush for the first new thirdgeneration iPads sold

to begin selling the iPad stealing an 8hour march on Apple David Tarasenko a 34yearold construction manager who was the first to pick up the iPad said ever since Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook

Apple  which sports a highdefinition retina display and comes with a better camera  is capable of operating on highspeed 4G LTE or LongTerm Evolution network But this version is not compatible with

elsewhere if necessary I save money on my other purchases for hightech shopping said Henry a systems engineer at a railway company who was hoping to buy his first iPad mainly to watch films and read during his more than two hours of travel per day Some US retailers offered special deals At Target customers who traded in their working iPad 2 could receive up to 350 in store credit a spokeswoman said MARKET LEAD Tablet sales are expected to increase to 326 million by 2015 with Apple largely dominating the market according to research firm Gartner By then tablets could rival sales of desktop computers which Gartner expects to total 368 million units this year The enduring popularity of Apple products and stock have provided Chief Executive Tim Cook who took over after the death of Steve Jobs last year with a good start The stock has jumped 45 percent this year to a market value of about 550 billion Canaccord Genuity analysts raised their target price on Apple stock to 710 from 665 Dickie Chang an analyst with technology research firm IDC said Cook will need to do more in future to keep up the companys astonishing momentum The iPad is already a pretty mature product and its hard to revolutionize it any further he said I think he may have to come up with another product to mark his stamp That could come in the form of launching a smaller iPad with a longer battery life for instance UBS raised its target price to 675 from 550 and said the expected launch of the redesigned iPhone 5 in October was the big catalyst ahead Apples top manufacturer is Foxconn Technology Group whose factories in China are under scrutiny over labor practices Small groups of labor activists tried to draw attention to the issue at stores in New York and San Francisco where Apple employees handed out umbrellas to customers waiting in the rain Charlotte Hill a representative of changeorg called for better worker protection We are hoping Apples workers and people higher up in the corporate chain will hear us she said in San Francisco where about 200 to 300 people had lined up prior to the opening of the downtown store Amanda Bell a law student and part of a group of protesters in New York said There is a cognitive dissonance for most people between loving the product and hating the way its made SMUGGLERS The new iPad went on sale on Friday in 10 regions including Britain Canada Germany Hong Kong Japan Singapore and Switzerland Most of the countries outside the United States do not yet have the faster fourthgeneration telecoms networks that the new iPad supports but that did not stop Apples fans Ive come from Russia to buy an iPad for my threeyearold son David Oleg Konovalov a newspaper salesman told Reuters in Tokyo Everyone in Russia wants an iPad but to buy it there I will have to wait several months This reminds me of the time 30 years ago when I waited 8 hours in the cold to see Lenins Mausoleum In London 21yearold Piotr who works at noodle bar Wagamama said Its not for me its to sell I will bring them to Russia to sell them In the Chinese city of Shenzhen people keen to get their hands on the new iPad waited for them to be smuggled across the border from Hong Kong We dont have iPad3s yet but some will arrive later in the day when the students deliver them to us Well have more supplies over this weekend said a store operator in Shenzhen Customs has become stricter but if you take one at a time across the border thats still pretty safe At most theyll ask you to take it out of the box to prove that its for self use Online reviews of the new iPad overwhelmingly praised Apple for its improved screen resolution My epiphany came when I placed my iPad 2 next to the new model with the same text on the screen Letters and words that had seemed sharp on the older model five minutes earlier suddenly looked fuzzier said one reviewer Shintaro Aizawa 16 who waited 15 hours outside a Tokyo store said After this well Ill first of all open it up and check its as beautiful as I thought Then Ill get some sleep GOLD STANDARD As consumers lined up around city streets to buy the iPad one firm that took the new device apart said Qualcomm Inc Broadcom Corp and Samsung Electronics had all held on to their prized roles as key parts suppliers The inner workings of the iPad are similar to previous models based on a teardown by a tinkerer from California gadgetrepair firm iFixit who queued up in Australia to get one of the new tablets and quickly took it apart for a Web blog IFixit said the iPads display appears to be from Samsung Apples closest rival in the tablet market It includes a Qualcomm LTE cellphone chip and a Qualcomm wireless modem for 3G and 4G Broadcom supplies a semiconductor handling wireless tasks like WiFi and

515,Apple,3/19/2012,How to Play It: A dividend strategy with Apple in mind,1, NEW YORK  Reuters  Apple isnt the only prominent company that analysts have tagged as a potential source of dividend payouts Investors can target the sweet spot of reliable income and share price gains by buying companies that are likely to initiate or increase dividends   With nearly 100 billion in cash on its balance sheet Apple will initiate a dividend and share buyback that will total 45 billion over three years A quarterly dividend of 265 per share will begin in July marking Appless first such payout since 1995 Its a move that many institutional investors have been expecting Apple increased its earnings per share by 83 percent in 2011 but its shares traded at pricetoearnings multiples more in line with industries like railroads or grocery stores than innovative technology businesses Apples huge cash pile was one reason for its low PE because investors were acting as if shareholders would never see the benefit of that cash Here then are suggestions on how to build a dividend strategy with Apple in mind OTHER TECH COMPANIES Analysts expect Apples large technology peers to follow the leader and boost their dividend payouts If anybody can make dividends cool its Apple said Christopher Davis a fund analyst at Morningstar who covers dividend funds With higherthanaverage cash levels on their balance sheets and strong brand names many tech companies look more like classic value companies than the gogo growth stocks of the late 1990s Those cheap valuations may help these giant tech companies sustain share gains even if the market rally fizzles Microsoft pays a dividend with a yield of 24 percent while Cisco Systems pays a dividend yield of 16 percent Higher dividends would make these largecap technology companies even more attractive to fund managers and other institutional investors analysts say And more dividend initiations could be coming out of Silicon Valley With Apple set to pay a dividend with a yield of 18 percent Google now becomes one of the largest tech companies that does not offer a payout The company has some 45 billion in cash and is trading at a pricetobook value of 35 well below Apples 71 pricetobook value Digesting the pending acquisition of Motorola Mobility will keep them occupied for now but longer term Googles core business is a strong cash generator and a dividend would be one way to put that cash to work said Daniel Ernst an analyst at Hudson Square Research in New York A technologyfocused ETF could be another way to play possible dividend increases in the sector The 95 billion Technology Select SPDR for example is top heavy with dividend payers Apple Microsoft International Business Machines and ATT accounting for 41 percent of the funds assets Google is the fifthlargest holding at 53 percent The fund which costs 18 cents per 100 invested yields 133 percent GROWING DIVIDEND FUNDS The volatility in the stock market last year made dividend strategies increasingly popular Dividendfocused funds and ETFs collectively had 173 billion in inflows last year despite a broader investor push away from equity funds according to Morningstar data Its a trend that shows few signs of letting up despite a new risk the end of low tax rates on dividends Dividend income tax rules are set to revert to the preGeorge W Bush era which means dividends will be taxed at ordinary income rates of up to 396 percent The tax is currently 15 percent Investors who focus on dividends argue that they are a sign of a strong balance sheet and a proven business model Classic dividend payers like Johnson  Johnson and Exxon Mobil tend to hold their value during volatile markets because of the payouts said Linda Duessel a senior equity strategist at Federated Investors specializing in equity income Whats more many blue chip companies pay higher dividends than 10year Treasuries which currently yield about 24 percent While these stocks come with more risks than US bonds their large cash positions are attractive to incomeseeking investors The 96 billion Vanguard Dividend Growth fund is one way to target companies upping their shareholder payouts It yields 19 percent and costs 34 cents per 100 invested Automatic Data Processing Occidental Petroleum and PepsiCo are among its largest holdings Be prepared for the fund to lag the market during rallies like the current one The fund is up 71 percent so far this year which is five percentage points behind the broad SP 500 index Its longterm performance is better however The fund is up an annualized 56 percent over the last 10 years or 17 percentage points above the SP 500 Reporting By David Randall Editing by Jennifer Merritt and Steve Orlofsky,85.48143,53.214287
516,Apple,3/19/2012,Apple's Cook finally shares $98 billion cache,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook moving swiftly after taking over from late Silicon Valley icon Steve Jobs fulfilled a longstanding desire of investors by initiating a quarterly dividend and share buyback that will pay out 45 billion over three years   The worlds most valuable company will start paying its first dividends since 1995  a regular quarterly payout of 265 a share  in July and buy back up to 10 billion of its stock beginning in the next fiscal year The 10 billion annual dividend program which Cook said will be reviewed periodically ranks among the largest current US corporate cash payouts Yet it disappointed some fund managers given a 18 percent dividend yield that lags the Standard  Poors 500 average and its modest size versus a 98 billion war chest Apple has accumulated selling Macintosh computers and iPhones On Monday the company said it had sold 3 million of its latest 4Genabled iPads setting a firstweekend record for the line of tablet computers Cook told analysts on Monday that making great products remained top priority echoing the sentiments of his former boss who died last October after a long battle with cancer Jobs former lieutenant has impressed Wall Street since taking the helm He made his mark revealing Apples production partners and initiating investigations into allegations of labor abuse in its supply chain and addressing investors directly at this years Goldman Sachs conference But the question of whether the operations maven can envision revolutionary products lingers for some Already we are seeing more openness and more willingness to address issues on many different fronts under Tim Cook than we had seen in the past said Connor Browne portfolio manager of Thornburg Value Fund While all this other stuff is good there is still some pressure on management to come out with fantastic products over the coming months he said Cooks move came less than a year after he was appointed head of the company and suggested to many a move away from Jobs era when a dividend was often mentioned but not acted upon Under Jobs Apple maintained that capital preservation was key and the company needed the flexibility of having a cash pile Apple shares ended up 27 percent at 60110 after notching a record of 60177 just before its close on the Nasdaq DIFFERENT STYLE When Cook was announced as CEO of one of the most highly recognizable brands Wall Street feared he lacked Jobs uncanny vision for groundbreaking consumer electronics But Apples shares have gained more than 50 percent since Jobs death and set a record above 600 last week as investors noted the assurance with which Cook has taken the reins Within company headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop there remains a sense of urgency despite the success former Apple executive and venture capitalist JeanLouis Gassee said Cook was part of what made Apple such a juggernaut when Steve was running the show Gassee said He now follows Steves advice Dont try to be me be yourself Michael Holt analyst with Morningstar said Cook was putting his own slant on things but some of the companys core areas such as product development have not changed under him The influence of Steve Jobs is very heavy on not only the current products but also products that are in the pipeline Holt said So its kind of a balance Cook a former IBM executive and Apple longtime chief operating officer oversaw the rollout of the iPhone 4S last year and presided over what he said on Monday was a record weekend of sales for the new 4Genabled iPad Innovation is the most important objective at Apple and we will not lose sight of that Cook said during the rare latequarter conference call Many investors now await an Apple TV or a similar device a gadget that will transform an industry the way the iPhone did On a conference call one of the first questions that cropped up regarded the product pipeline Cook declined comment One of the risks with Apple in particular is that they have very little in recurring revenues Most of the revenue is new sales which means that innovation is absolutely critical Oliver Pursche manager of the GMG Defensive Beta fund Thats one of the reasons that the PE is so low FINALLY Apple joins the ranks of Silicon Valley blue chips that have recently begun doling out dividends including Cisco Systems Inc which announced its firstever cash payout in March 2011 Among major technology companies Apple rival Google Inc remains a prominent holdout Analysts said the initiation of a regular payout would attract a broader investor base but added that many funds had already piled in on hopes of a dividend after Cook said this year there were active discussions at the top level about what to do with its 98 billion hoard of cash and securities A lot of mutual funds that say theyre buying dividend companies had Apple in them That shouldnt be but I guess it was obvious that after Tim Cook spoke last time that this was the case said William Lefkowitz chief options strategist at VFinance Investments Apple expects the share buyback program to run over three years with the primary objective to offset the impact of employee stock options and equity grants Its annual dividend yield will come in around 18 percent That ranks above Oracle Corp and International Business Machines Corp but falls just short of the average of around 24 percent for companies in the Standard  Poors 500 index analysts say The company will still maintain a war chest for other strategic opportunities Cook said These decisions will not close any doors for us The maker of the iPhone iPad and iPod has 98 billion in cash and securities equal to about 104 a share Apple said it anticipated using about 45 billion of domestic cash in the first three years of its buyback and dividend programs Asked about the substantial cash Apple has parked overseas Chief Financial Official Peter Oppenheimer said the company had no plans to repatriate it at this time The current tax laws provide a considerable economic disincentive to US companies that might otherwise repatriate the substantial amount of foreign cash that they have he said Thats our view And weve expressed it Additional reporting by  Yinka Adegoke   Sinead Carew  David Randall and  Nicola Leske  in New York and  Tarmo Virki  in Helsinki Writing by

522,Apple,3/26/2012,Apple's gains make some mutual funds riskier,1, NEW YORK  Reuters  When it comes to Apple investors could become victims of their own success   It is a dilemma more mutual fund managers are wrestling with due to the companys nearly 48 percent gain this year Those who bought Apple well below its current price have seen the value of their investment balloon sometimes to more than 10 percent of their funds assets That effectively turns a brilliant decision into a concentrated stake undercutting the benefits of diversification and making some mutual funds riskier As Apple stock has marched higher welltimed bets on the company have helped some growthoriented and blended mutual funds outperform the broad market But in doing so many of those funds have now tied investor dollars closer to the performance of a single company This isnt much of an issue when it comes to funds that market themselves as narrow bets on technology But many funds whose broad holdings could be the core of a 401k or similar retirement plan  Fidelitys 147 billion Blue Chip Growth and the 287 billion T Rowe Price Growth fund among them  are stocking up on Apple Apple makes up nearly 9 percent of Fidelitys 808 billion Contrafund for instance The fund is the sixthmost popular holding in 401k plans nationwide according to BrightScope a firm that ranks company 401k plans A dramatic fall in Apples shares however unlikely that may seem at the moment would quickly ripple across the retirement accounts of millions of investors who thought they were safer investing in funds than individual shares It adds to the risk profile of a fund to have a significant stake in one stock because it makes them more susceptible to bad news on one or two stocks and they wont be able to cushion the blow with diversification said Todd Rosenbluth a senior fund analyst at Standard  Poors Capital IQ Generally in the mutual fund industry any position over 5 percent of assets is considered a large bet that may influence a fund said Dan Culloton a fund analyst at Morningstar CONCENTRATED BETS Shares of Apple have nearly doubled from the 310 they hit in June 2011 and at about 600 a share are up nearly 48 percent in 2012 alone Apple currently the worlds most valuable company by market capitalization now has a weighting of 42 percent in the broad SP 500 portfolio the benchmark against which the performance of most US mutual funds are judged That means 42 cents of every 1 invested in a SP 500 index fund will be allocated to Apple shares before fees By definition actively managed mutual funds have overweight positions in companies they think will outperform the broad market but usually not more than 5 or 6 percent But 46 funds tracked by Morningstar have stakes in Apple that exceed 9 percent of assets or roughly double the companys weighting in the SP 500 index This does not include sector funds that focus on technology or other specialized investment The 15 billion Oppenheimer Main Street Select fund for instance blends value and growth stocks in its portfolio of 34 companies It had 105 percent of its assets or two and half times the benchmark weight in Apple as of the end of January according to Morningstar data That concentrated bet is one reason that the fund is up 139 percent so far this year or 26 percentage points above the broad SP 500 index A dip in Apples share price and the fund could fall more than the broad market The fund managers declined to comment Fidelitys Contrafund meanwhile focuses on growth stocks It holds 427 stocks but 86 percent of its portfolio or a total of 66 billion was concentrated in Apple at the end of January That stake is more than even Apples weighting of 76 percent in the narrower Russell 1000 Growth index which many growth fund managers use as an internal benchmark The Contrafund is up 137 percent since the start of 2012 Fidelity declined to comment Some reluctance on the part of portfolio managers to sell Apple shares is understandable Trimming exposure could lead to underperformance for a fund We hear about this a lot from portfolio managers I have no doubt that theyd like to sell it and take their profits but you have to be in it to win it and right now Apples momentum is going up said Howard Silverblatt senior index analyst at SP These fund managers usually realize that they are taking on additional risk Silverblatt said What helped you on the way up kills you on the way down CUTTING RISK Some fund managers are taking steps to lower the weighting of Apple in their portfolios We got to the point where it was an inordinate part of our portfolio and in order to control risk it was only prudent to trim it back said Robert S Bacarella a Wheaton Illinois fund manager who runs the 49 million Monetta fund with his son Bacarella first bought 10000 shares of Apple in early 2005 when it traded at around 40 per share In September 2005 those 10000 shares were worth 536100 and accounted for 09 percent of his portfolio according to Morningstar data Fast forward to December 2011 and Bacarella again had 10000 shares of Apple This time however their value was nearly 41 million which accounted for 93 percent of his funds weight He trimmed his shares by 5000 earlier this year Apple now makes up 5 percent of his assets This is about risk control You never know what is going to happen he said The sizeable positions built up by other funds would only exacerbate an Apple fall  he added If everyone sees deceleration of earnings growth what will you do Bacarella asks I would think that youre going to bail and that will compound to the downside Reporting By David Randall Editing by  Walden Siew  Jennifer Merritt and  Tim Dobbyn ,85.684288,53.91

seeks to clear up a pile of problems in the firms biggest growth market from its contested iPad trademark to treatment of local labor   Cook is on his first trip to the country since taking over from late cofounder Steve Jobs in August keeping to a closely guarded agenda that has included talks on Monday with Beijings mayor and a visit to one of Apples two stores in the capital Tim is in China meeting with government officials China is very important to us and we look forward to even greater investment and growth there said Carolyn Wu China spokeswoman for the maker of iPhones iPads and iPods Wu declined to give details of Cooks full agenda other than to say he would meet other government officials on Tuesday Cook was photographed smiling by eager fans at the Apple store who posted some of the images on social networking sites The new chief executive has a thicket of problems to cut through in China which is both Apples most important manufacturing hub and biggest potential market China is the worlds largest mobile market and already Apples secondbiggest market overall but the firm has been losing ground there to arch rival Samsung Electronics in smartphones and has yet to introduce the latest version of its topselling iPad to the country In the last quarter of 2011 Apple captured three quarters of Chinas tablet PC market while its iPhone ranked fifth in the countrys smartphone sector industry figures show SCRATCHED THE SURFACE Apple has deals in place with China Telecom and Unicom to sell its iPhone in the country with the only other Chinese carrier China Mobile looking to clinch a deal with the California company An alliance with China Mobile the countrys biggest mobile carrier is viewed by many industry analysts as crucial to the acceleration of iPhone sales through China though compatibility problems with the carriers network have yet to be resolved Cook has said that Apple has merely scratched the surface in China as it looks to expand It has only five stores in the country though it also sells through more than 100 resellers Apple is also waging a legal battle with a Chinese firm over the local rights to the iPad trademark The longrunning dispute with Proview  a financially weak technology company that claims to have registered the trademark  is making its way through Chinese courts and has threatened to disrupt iPad sales Proview executives declined to comment on Tuesday over whether they will be meeting Cook No meetings have been set so far between the Apple chief and the Chinese companys lawyers and creditors sources familiar with the situation said He should be here to also understand more of the iPad issue and handle the situation said one source close to Proview Hejun Vanguard Group a consulting company representing Proview creditors issued an open letter to Cook on the occasion of his China visit on the trademark lawsuit Proviews creditors said they are overseeing the assets of the lossmaking company Proview Technology Shenzhen said earlier in March it was in talks with a creditor that was seeking its bankruptcy We are willing to fight the trademark case for five 10 years or even longer Hejun Vanguard said Well see how long the biggest company in the world can exploit the law and intellectual property rights in China Apple has not launched its new iPad in China yet so people have been smuggling the new gadget from as far away as the United States and Australia The new iPad has also been smuggled in from Hong Kong The device hit a hurdle in Australia on Tuesday as the countrys consumer regulator accused Apple of misrepresenting the iPads ability to connect to fast 4G mobile data networks and said it would seek corrections in advertising and refunds Apple is also reviewing labor standards at the Taiwan firm it uses to assemble its iPhones and iPads Foxconn Technology Group which has been accused of running sweatshops in China The group is the Taiwan parent of Hong Konglisted Foxconn International Holdings Ltd and Taiwanlisted Hon Hai Precision At the outset of Cooks visit to China an activist group based in Hong Kong published an open letter demanding that Apple ensure decent working conditions at all its suppliers As the former chief operating officer Cook helped set up Apples sprawling supply chain centered on Asia In the open letter Students  Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour listed grievances cited by employees at Apple suppliers including poverty wages and excessive and forced overtime They describe their daily routine as work eat and sleep They described themselves as machines that repeated the same monotonous motion for thousands of times a day it said With all its success in the global marketplace Apple undoubtedly has the ability to rectify these problems Apple notes that it has begun releasing labor data monthly and that it reached 84 percent compliance with its 60hour work week policy in January according to a survey of 500000 workers at suppliers worldwide For February compliance to the 60hour work week rose to 89 percent with the average work week 48 hours Apple says Thats a substantial improvement over previous

526,Apple,3/29/2012,Foxconn raises bar on U.S. firms in China: auditor,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  A monthlong investigation by the Fair Labor Association covering three Chinese factories run by Apple Incs main contract manufacturer Foxconn revealed a host of issues from excessive overtime to problems with overtime compensation   The DCbased nonprofit group has been conducting its probe at Foxconn facilities in Guanlan Longhua and Chengdu in China since February after Apple joined the group this year The worlds most valuable technology company hopes it will counter criticism it does not care about worker issues in its manufacturing chain Foxconn agreed to reduce working hours while protecting pay and benefits as remedial measures Reuters spoke with FLA President Auret van Heerden after its report was released Here are edited excerpts from the interview Q How did this package come together A We had a closing meeting where we had the owner of Foxconn CEO of Foxconn the senior vice president of operations of Apple We had a very big delegation of top managers from all sides And they were very very open to these recommendations Terry Gou CEO of Foxconn came up with a number of suggestions himself and he has really decided to get ahead of this game in a way He decided to not just look at incremental changes He is really pushing the envelope His decision to go to full compliance  sets a very high bar for the rest of the industry Q What are the next steps A Apple has asked us to look at eight or nine of the final assembly suppliers  the key ones That will last the rest of the year Apple is an affiliate of the FLA They also have a regular due diligence cycle which they have to go with We are not just looking at the final assembly but taking more of a riskbased approach and trying to identify three or four different levels of the supply chain where the greatest risks lie and starting to analyze those Q Any companies you are going to be looking at apart from Foxconn A Were still planning that so I cant give you any exact names right now Q Would reducing overtime hours impact volume A I dont think so They cant afford any kind of interruptions in supplies So thats one of the reasons why this plan needs to be implemented over a oneyear lead time They need to obviously hire a lot more workers to make up for the reduced hours They need to build dormitory facilities for those workers make sure theyre trained so that there is no wobble in the output Foxconn doesnt only supply Apple It supplies 50 percent of I guess the consumer electronics industry So there are a lot of people who have a lot riding on this Q How farreaching is this action Would it have an impact on the electronic supply chain A Apple and Foxconn are obviously the two biggest players in this sector and since theyre teaming up to drive this change I really do think they set the bar for the rest of the sector And if you look at the labor market situation theres a very tight labor market in China right now Theres a shortage of workers Foxconn is proposing this better deal  This will start to attract more workers and the best workers So I think their competitors will be obliged to offer a similar package just in order to get enough workers Q Was it your recommendation on overtime hours that Foxconn has agreed to implement A It was their recommendation they really bought into this This is really coming from them They decided to do this and theyre driving this in They know they have to do this on all their lines because otherwise workers on the other lines are going to protest that they want the same deal Q Was it stressful to do these audits Can you give some color A It was certainly the biggest exercise that we or anyone has ever undertaken This is by far the biggest factory assessment that has been done to date And just the logistics of interviewing 35000 workers over a threeweek period was quite challenging I would say that what we found is pretty much in line with what we find elsewhere in China so there werent any surprises in that sense The hours of work situation is what you really expect to find and in a way what was quite interesting is what we didnt find We didnt find any child labor and we didnt find any wage violations We didnt find any forced labor But again I would say that tracks pretty much with the Chinese labor market situation And then I think for us really the most eyeopening part of it was this agreement to cut hours to Chinese legal limits Not just to go to Apple code standards but to go beyond that That was the biggest surprise for us Q Is this a watershed moment in the Chinese labor market and would this have an impact on the wage situation in China A Certainly the Chinese government has made it quite clear that they want wages to continue to increase in doubledigit figures for the next five years and theyve signaled that clearly Theyve even made some projections of it so we will continue to see wage increases And I think this additional free time workers have will mean they can consume more And that again goes to one of the Chinese governments economic objectives  to boost domestic consumption In that sense Foxconn would be setting something of an example Thats very much what the Chinese government wants to see Q Will this agreement lead to any problem in supply A No Im sure that in making this commitment theyve already done their homework and they know exactly how theyre going to maintain supply at the same time Q How do you plan to keep track of whether Foxconn is implementing these changes A We will conduct onsite verification visits We have detailed action plans with the actual deliverables the names of the people who are responsible and the deadlines We will continue to update those and we will report out publicly This is something we will follow closely Q Will this come to fruition in one year or will we see changes soon A Some of the action items were immediate and they were dealt with on the spot and others have onemonth threemonth sixmonth timelines We have a list of items were checking them off as we go along and the big one  of course the hours of work one  is due to be completed by July 2013 Q The survey reveals that many workers want to work more That seems to counter what Apple and Foxconn are striving for A Its an interesting finding We find that in a lot of developing countries workers have ambition they have aspirations Particularly migrant workers go to find work with a view to make as much money as they can in the shortest time possible So they do push for extra hours especially overtime hours that are paid at a premium Theres something of a tension there between our code standards and our legal standards which call for shorter hours and the objectives of these migrant workers This will call for very very careful consultation with workers to make sure that they dont resist this plan Q Is Apple footing the bill for this A Im not party to those discussions as to how they are going to absorb the costs Reporting by Poornima Gupta Additional reporting by  Malathi Nayak  Editing by  Gary Hill ,87.540001,53.91
527,Apple,3/29/2012,Analysis: Disinflationary wave from China already waned,0, WASHINGTON  Reuters  A big improvement in labor conditions at plants that produce Apples iPhones iPads and iPods in China which was announced on Thursday is unlikely to create much more than a ripple in prices across the West   While the reduced overtime hours increased hiring and improved safety will raise labor costs for the gigantic contract manufacturer Foxconn that Apple uses in China they are such a small part of the overall cost of the smart phones tablets and music players that the shift can be largely absorbed economists said Any impact from higher Chinese labor costs is also being offset by the feebleness of the global economy after the financial crisis The disinflationary wave that swept the world from the 1990s onwards because of cheap Chinese production has been fading for some years and is now close to an end yet prices in the United States and Europe have not surged Wages in China have been rising steadily by 15 percent a year for rural migrants since 2005 making the latest agreement between Foxconn Technology Group and Apple part of a broader trend already underway A range of other factors also has boosted the price of exports carrying the Made in China label  Chinas land prices domestic inflation rising energy costs and a tightening supply of labor particularly as the Chinese population ages We dont expect China to be exporting disinflation again said Bill Adams senior international economist at PNC Corp Beijing is trying to rebalance its economy away from exports toward domestic consumption To that end it has declared it wants average incomes to grow more quickly than nominal gross domestic product over the next five years  essentially welcoming higher wages Yet the shifting China effect has not tipped the scale toward inflation in advanced economies still struggling in the aftermath of the credit crisis The IMF forecasts they will see 14 percent inflation this year compared with the 24 percent average for 19932002 Its fair to say that we have moved from an extended disinflation from China to an extended period of at least weaker disinflationary pressure from China said Derek Scissors senior fellow at the Heritage Foundations Asia Studies Center But the effect is being masked in the US and elsewhere by consolidation of household balance sheets after the financial crisis We cant see a pricing shift because the global economy is too weak he said US IMPACT While the price of Chinese goods imported to the United States rose by 36 percent last year the fastest pace since the United States started keeping China import price records in 2003 there are few signs this has had much impact on overall US inflation Firstly Chinese imports accounted for only 27 percent of all spending by American consumers on goods and services in 2010 and less than half of that reflected the actual cost of the Chinese imports The rest was markups by US businesses that transported warehoused distributed and sold the goods the San Francisco Federal Reserve said in a study last year In other words for every dollar spent on a Made in China item 55 cents on average went to US businesses and workers This suggests that Chinese inflation will have little direct effect on US consumer prices the regional Fed concluded More precisely if China were to pass through a 5 percent inflation rate it would raise the Feds favorite price index the personal consumption expenditure index by only 01 percentage point it said Chinas inflation currently is running below that at a 32 percent annual rate The University of California at Irvine has illustrated the point graphically It broke down the value of an Apple iPad and found that Chinese labor costs accounted for only 2 percent Materials were 31 percent of the value Apple profits second at 30 percent and distribution and retail costs 15 percent US costs are a far bigger factor on the order of 101 said Scissors RENMINBI A study by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the revaluation of Chinas currency known locally as the renminbi or yuan could be more significant than labor costs The yuan has risen in value by 30 percent since depegging began in June 2005 BLS data show that Chinese import prices have risen more or less in tandem albeit with a lag see attached graphic Import prices slid 33 percent when the yuan stalled from the summer of 2008 during the financial crisis and then resumed their climb when revaluation started up again Chinas exchange rate policy undoubtedly affects import prices in the United States However other factors such as labor costs input costs and Chinas export mix will also have an impact the BLS said Another factor dampening the effect of rising labor costs on the final price charged for products is that Chinese manufacturers are moving inland where labor and land are cheaper and they are raising labor productivity Investing in capital equipment and automating manufacturing processes is essential if China wants to remain competitive and its pool of cheap labor starts to dry up said PNC Corps Adams He noted that entrants to the labor force between the ages of 17 and 20 are already declining year on year Chinese labor is a small share of the retail prices in the United States Adams said Reporting By Stella

528,Apple,3/29/2012,Apple labor plan to ripple through China factories,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apparel makers toy companies and other manufacturers wrestling with rising wages in China now face new pressures after Apple Inc and main production partner Foxconn agreed to improve worker conditions at plants making its iPhones and other gadgets   In a major development for the way Western companies do business in China Apple said on Thursday it agreed to work with Foxconn  an affiliate of Taiwans Hon Hai Precision Industry  to curtail hours substantially improve wages and hire tens of thousands to compensate for the reduced hours With enviable profit margins and the ability to call the shots with suppliers Apples move to better labor conditions is not expected to force it to raise prices But Apples move may indirectly force more laborintensive manufacturers in the worlds second largest economy  like clothing makers  to spend more on wages and accept lower profits As a result of electronics companies raising wages thats going to impact the entire manufacturing sector said Paul Martyn vice president of Supply Strategy at BravoSolution The AppleFoxconn agreement could affect costs for other manufacturers who contract with the Taiwanese company including Dell Inc HewlettPackard Amazoncom Inc Motorola Mobility Holdings Nokia and Sony Corp But with labor accounting for only a fraction of those companies costs they are expected to face limited pressure to raise their own prices or sacrifice profit margins After decades of aggressive expansion in China cheap labor no longer looks limitless and steadily rising wages have become a major concern of USbased companies heavily dependent on Chinese labor Better wages paid in Chinas electronics industry have already been rippling out to less complex manufacturing sectors like clothing shoes and toys where labor is a bigger proportion of overall costs Best Buy Co CEO Brian Dunn said he is keeping an eye on rising wages in China but argued that whatever margin pressures the electronics retail chain faces would be felt by all Whatever plays out there will be unilaterally applied across whoever sells these goods he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday WINNERS AND LOSERS Apples new plan to hire tens of thousands of workers clamp down on illegal overtime improve safety protocols and upgrade worker housing is expected to eventually fuel even more pressure to improve wages across the manufacturing industry Apple and Foxconn are obviously the two biggest players in this sector and since theyre teaming up to drive this change I really do think they set the bar for the rest of the sector Auret van Heerden head of the Fair Labor Association told Reuters Compared to the costs of microchips sensors highend displays and other components that go into a laptop or smartphone labor is only a tiny part believed by some analysts to be no more than 5 percent of the cost in the case of Apples iPhone Dell told Reuters in an email the company was pleased Foxconn is improving its labor practices but We wont speculate how the reduced overtime and higher wages will affect Foxconns costs In consumer electronics changes in component prices and the launch of more profitable products tend to mask or offset rising wages for products sold by companies like Hewlett Packard Dell and Motorola Mobility analysts say Wages in China have been increasing significantly for years and that hasnt had any effect on retail prices said Brad Gastwirth cofounder of ABR Investment Strategy an independent research firm And there are other trends happening  the shift to Ultrabooks and other bettermargin products that are helping offset higher labor costs Apples decision comes after the Fair Labor Association said it had unearthed multiple violations of labor law including extreme hours and unpaid overtime disclosing its findings from a survey of three Foxconn plants and over 35000 workers Apple had agreed to the probe by the independent FLA in response to a crescendo of criticism that its products were built on the backs of mistreated Chinese workers Shenzhen a major manufacturing hub in southern China increased its minimum wage by 136 percent in February despite warnings from factory owners and exporters already reeling from slow US and European demand Chinas largest contract manufacturer Foxconn is in a strong position compared to its smaller rivals but it would still be difficult for the company to get customers like Apple HP and Amazon which makes the Kindle Fire tablet in China to bear the brunt of higher labor costs If Foxconn tries to increase prices Amazon could go to other major contract manufacturers like Quanta Wistron Pegatron or Inventec to see what they could do for the company said Mark Gerber director of technology research at brokerage Detwiler Fenton To make up for rising wages manufacturers most sensitive to labor costs like apparel makers or toy makers may cut corners on the products they produce BravoSolutions Martyn said For example higher wages in electronics manufacturing could eventually spill over to factories making plastic toys and force US fastfood restaurants to use lowerquality trinkets in their promotions aimed at kids he said We may see a reduction in the diversity of products offered or a reduction in quality Martyn said We may see more

537,Apple,4/11/2012,U.S. sues Apple publishers in e-book price scheme,0, WASHINGTONSAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  The US government sued Apple Inc and five publishers saying they conspired to fix the prices of electronic books and reached a settlement with three of the publishers that could lead to cheaper ebooks for consumers   The Justice Department accused Apple of colluding with the five publishers as the Silicon Valley giant was launching its iPad in early 2010 and was seeking to break up Amazoncoms lowcost dominance in the digital book market Because of the agreement ebook prices went up an average of 2 to 3 in a threeday period in early 2010 according to the Justice Department lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday The settlement reached with three of the publishers will allow Amazon to resume discounting books and will terminate the most favored nation contracts with Apple Amazon said in response to the settlement that it plans to lower prices on books associated with its Kindle ereader The pact also requires the publishers to wait two years before entering into any agency model agreements that prevent retailers from offering discounts on electronic books The publishers who agreed to settle are News Corps HarperCollins Publishers Inc CBS Corps Simon  Schuster Inc and Lagardere SCAs Hachette Book Group Hachette and HarperCollins also settled with a group of US states agreeing to pay 51 million in restitution to consumers who bought ebooks Publishers Macmillan a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH and Pearson Plcs Penguin Group plan to fight the Justice Department charges along with Apple James McQuivey a media analyst at Forrester Research said ebook prices were destined to come down even without a Justice Department settlement because publishers themselves have been experimenting with discounting to stimulate sales It essentially will accelerate the reversion back to the sub10 prices that Amazon had already established as the standard McQuivey said The ebook market has boomed in recent years Sales grew from 78 million in sales in 2008 to 17 billion in 2011 according to Albert Greco a bookindustry expert at the business school of Fordham University A Pew Research Center survey released last week found that one in five American adults read an ebook in the last year SOME PUBLISHERS DEFIANT US Attorney General Eric Holder told a news conference in Washington that executives at the highest levels of Apple and the publishers worked together to eliminate competition among sellers of ebooks During December 2009 and January 2010 the publisher defendants US chief executives placed at least 56 phone calls to one another the complaint alleges As a result of this alleged conspiracy we believe that consumers paid millions of dollars more for some of the most popular titles Holder said Apple had no comment about the federal lawsuit A person familiar with the matter said Apple has not been part of the settlement negotiations In a recent court filing in a private class action suit on the same issue Apple said it had not colluded with the publishers but individually negotiated separate vertical agreements with each of the publishers Macmillan Chief Executive John Sargent released a defiant letter to the book industry on Wednesday saying the publisher did not collude Sargent said Macmillan had been in discussions with the Justice Department for months but the settlement terms were too onerous After careful consideration we came to the conclusion that the terms could have allowed Amazon to recover the monopoly position it had been building before our switch to the agency model Sargent said Hachette said in a statement that it reluctantly agreed to join the federal and state settlements but it was not involved in a conspiracy to illegally fix the price of eBooks Penguin CEO John Makinson said his company did nothing wrong and was alone among the publishers in not holding any settlement discussions HarperCollins which also settled denied any wrongdoing Simon  Schuster declined to comment The European Commission is also probing Apple and publishers in a similar antitrust probe It said on Wednesday that it had received settlement proposals from Apple and four publishers  Simon  Schuster Harper Collins Hachette Livre and Macmillans parent JOBS ROLE The US government alleged that Apple and the publishers had a common interest in fighting Amazons practice of selling ebooks for as little as 999 as it was building market share and trying to drive sales of its Kindle reader Apples late cofounder and technology legend Steve Jobs figures prominently in the Justice Departments lawsuit with many instances of his personal involvement in negotiations with publishing executives about deal terms Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at 1299 and 1499 Jobs wrote to one of the publishers according to the Justice Departments complaint Apple successfully persuaded the publishers to adopt an agency model that allowed publishers to set the price of ebooks and in turn Apple would take a 30 percent cut the government said The Apple agreements with publishers effectively barred them from allowing rival retailers to sell the same books at lower prices The strategy upended the wholesale model in which retailers pay for the product and charge what they like The agency model of pricing is not itself illegal but it is illegal for competitors to collude to set prices The Justice Department complaint charges that the publishers regularly communicated with each other about Amazons ebook strategies and on ways to solve the 999 problem Chief executives at rival publishing houses met regularly in private rooms at upscale Manhattan restaurants the government alleged The complaint says the publishers took steps to conceal their communications with each other including instructions to double delete email and other measures to erase a paper trail The government said the publishers then received assurances from both each other and Apple that they would move together to raise the retail prices of ebooks Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal a former Connecticut attorney general said the Justice Departments action was particularly important because it involved a new and growing consumer market If it were not a new kind of product people would say its a kind of garden variety violation of law he said The idea that this innovation can be stifled is particularly

556,Apple,5/21/2012,AppleSamsung CEOs in U.S. court talks over patent row,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  The chief executives of Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd come face to face on Monday in courtdirected mediation in the United States over a dispute in which the iPhone maker claims the Korean firm has slavishly copied some of its products   Apples Tim Cook and Samsungs Choi Geesung have been instructed by a federal judge to appear for mediation in San Francisco to help resolve the bitter patent litigation between the two firms The US case the most closely watched in a global patent war between the two companies involving some 20 cases in 10 countries is set for trial at the end of July in San Jose California Each company denies the others allegations of patent infringement Patent expert Florian Mueller cautioned against any expectations that mediation which is being increasingly used to try to resolve US civil disputes would lead to a significant breakthrough in the case This dispute isnt ripe for settlement he said Under the present circumstances the two companies delegations should spend a couple of fun days in Yosemite Park or Napa Valley rather than meet in court only to pretend theyre being constructive Apple the maker of hit products such as the iPod iPad and iPhone has a complex relationship with Samsung a conglomerate that makes computer chips gadgets including its Galaxy range of smartphones and televisions While Samsungs smartphones and tablets run on Googles Android operating system and compete with Apples products Samsung is also a key components supplier to Apple The US company which investors value at close to 600 billion has accused Samsung of slavishly copying the iPhone and iPad through products that run on Android Samsung which has a stock market value of about 161 billion has countersued with claims accusing Apple of infringing its patents A Samsung representative declined to comment while Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet reiterated a prior statement that Apple needs to protect its intellectual property against blatant copying Both companies have a lot at stake in the case Their share prices hit record highs this year as they reported soaring profits partly fueled by their dominant position in the smartphone sector Samsung sold 445 million smartphones in the first quarter of 2012 giving it a 306 percent share of the global highend market Apples sales of 351 million iPhones gave it a 241 percent share BIG GAP On Sunday in Seoul the head of Samsungs mobile division said the South Korean company wanted to resolve differences with Apple There is still a big gap in the patent war with Apple JK Shin said before departing for the United States for the mediation talks But we still have several negotiation options Court documents show the two companies have had at least one mediation session although it is not clear if Cook and Choi were involved The latest mediation session scheduled for Monday and Tuesday will be overseen by US Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero He declined to comment Legal experts say the two firms are far from a settlement Samsung for example argues its technologies are worth 402000 won 350 or 60 percent of the iPhone retail price of 671000 won on the basis that 3G is the only function differentiating the phone from Apples digital music player iPod Touch Apple says Samsungs technology should be confined to modem chip prices or 29 percent of iPhone prices at best In July 2010 just a month after Samsung introduced its first Galaxy product Apple expressed its concerns to Samsung over its smartphone design and interface and demanded changes according to Apple lawyers Samsung didnt reflect those issues and continued to release products that copied Apples innovation they said Apple needs more time than it originally thought to reach a tipping point at which it has serious leverage over Samsung said Mueller Cook became Apple CEO last year taking over from the companys cofounder and inspiration Steve Jobs who had told his biographer he intended to go thermonuclear on Android Jobs died in October after a long illness Cook has echoed Jobs mantra that Apples top priority is to make great products but he has also made his mark by revealing the US companys production partners and initiating investigations into allegations of labor abuses in its supply chain Choi 61 became Samsungs leader in 2010 after more than three decades with the company He is seen as a mentor to Jay Lee the only son and heir apparent of Samsung Chairman Lee Kunhee Choi asked by reporters on Sunday about the court mediation declined to comment An eventual Apple and Samsung settlement could have wider implications because the US company is locked in disputes with major Android phone makers HTC Corp of Taiwan and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc of the United States US courts are increasingly demanding parties in civil disputes try mediation although success if far from certain Last year Oracles Larry Ellison and Googles Larry Page undertook mediation in an intellectual property fight over Android but no settlement was reached and a trial in the case is entering its sixth week I cant imagine that the heads of a major enterprise of that kind would take any more seriously a decision of that magnitude simply because they are in the room together said

interest but stressed the companys efforts would unfold gradually amid speculation the iPad and iPhone maker was on the brink of unveiling a revolutionary iTV   In one of his more revealing interviews since assuming the helm of the worlds most valuable company Cook also said he hoped someday to see Apple products manufactured in the United States and outlined his approach to managing an organization longassociated with its late founder Steve Jobs Another thing that Steve taught us all is to not to be focused on the past Cook told this years All Things Digital conference an annual gathering of Alist technology and media executives in the upscale California coastal resort town of Rancho Palos Verdes Industry insiders and executives say Apple may unveil a TVbased device in late 2012 or 2013 that has the potential to shake up the cozy television content and distribution industry the way the iPod and iPhone disrupted music and mobile content but Cook has steered clear of commenting on that issue directly This is an area of intense interest for us Cook said referring to Apples existing television settop box product Were going to keep pulling this string and see where it takes us When asked specifically if Apple was making a television set Cook said he was not going to answer that question Apple already sells a 99 set top box called Apple TV that streams Netflix and other content Cook who has previously said the Apple TV product had a hobby status inside the company noted the company was sticking with it despite not being known as a hobby kind of company Heres the way we would look at that not just at this area but other areas and ask can we control the key technology he said in response to a question about how Apple thinks about improving the television experience for consumers Can we make a significant contribution far beyond what others have done in this area Can we make a product that we would want Apple has been in negotiations with content companies for its devices It began talks earlier this year to stream films owned by EPIX which is backed by three major movie studios The company has a good relationship with content owners and doesnt see the need to own a content business Cook said adding he has met with several people in that business recently MADE IN USA In wideranging remarks Cook said he would like to see more of the companys products assembled at home than in China and contain more US components such as semiconductors Apple has been criticized for relying on lowcost Asian manufacturers to assemble its products and for contributing to the decline of the US manufacturing sector Cook who took the helm of the worlds most valuable technology company in August shortly before founder Steve Jobs died said manufacturing in the United States was difficult because of declining toolanddie manufacturing expertise among other things but he was working on it There are things that can be done in the US not just for the US market but that can be exported for the world Cook said On the assembly piece could that be done in the US I hope so again one day he added Apples final assembly is done through Asian contract manufacturers particularly Taiwans Foxconn Technology Group and its listed entity Hon Hai Precision Cook noted that Apple does some component manufacturing in the United States including the main microchip that runs the iPhone and iPad Apple makes the A5 processor in a 16 million squarefoot factory in Austin Texas owned by Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics Cook also said some of the glass for the iPhone and iPad is made in a plant in Kentucky The CEO talked about how the iPad was just in the first innings but declined to say what was in store for it next He reiterated his belief that many consumers will use the iPad more than computers In response to a question about PC softwaremaker Microsoft Corps efforts to enter the tablet market Cook brushed off the threat The more you look at the tablet as a PC the more the baggage from the past affects the product he said Apple released the iPad in 2010 and it has quickly defined the tablet computer market selling more than 67 million units so far DOUBLING DOWN ON SECRECY The 51year old Cook said he spends less time focused on marketing and design as CEO than his predecessor who Cook said spent virtually all of his time on those two things At a company the size of Apple Cook said having a strong team is critical You could have an S on your chest and a cape on your back and not be able to do everything said Cook who later cited Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr as well as Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger as figures that he looks up to Cook also discussed efforts to make the company more transparent on certain issues such as supplier responsibility and environmental matters but stressed he was committed to preserving Apples culture One Jobs legacy that Cook flagged is Apples wellknown penchant for going to great lengths to keep details of new products under tight wraps noting that he planned to double down on secrecy on products But he suggested Apple would not be constrained by

565,Apple,6/11/2012,Apple takes on Google with own maps better Siri,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc took the wraps off its own mobile mapping service and improved the search capabilities of its Siri electronic assistant technology as it rolled out soupedup software and hardware on Monday to help it wage war on Google Inc   CEO Tim Cook who took over from late cofounder Steve Jobs last August spearheaded the unveiling of new services  such as inhouse mapping beefedup Siri software addressbar search on its Safari browser  to help keep at bay Google and its fastgrowing Android mobile platform Apple tweaked a number of features in its mobile operating system to further its lead in enticing users to stay within its ecosystem The upgrades marked a bolstering of Apples arsenal as it tries to keep its topdown applications and hardware environment ahead of competition from Android device makers such as Samsung Electronics and Motorola Mobility The events key highlight was the debut of Apples new inhouse mapping service that the company has been working on the past few years Its new mobile operating software  the iOS6  comes with the mapping system built from the ground up said software chief Scott Forstall sidelining the Google map service that the Internet giant has invested heavily in Apple will be replacing Google Maps a preloaded app so far on the iPhone and iPad with its own inhouse map service delivering a big blow to Google which gets about half its map traffic from Apple devices The move signals that the friendship between Apple and Google  whose former CEO once sat on Apples board  is long over and underscores Apples efforts to reduce its ties with Google said Colin Gillis analyst with BGC Partners What happens if one day Google decides to not provide Apple with maps said Gillis You cant have that kind of dependency on a competitor Apples map service comes with threedimensional images of cities called Flyover along with realtime traffic updates and also turnbyturn navigation the last a feature that Google has in Android devices but had not made available in Apple devices And Siri the innovative voiceactivated iPhone searchfeature users have criticized as faulty and inadequate is now available on iPads and recites a larger database of answers especially sports restaurants and movies Siri is also integrated into the new mapping service so users can ask for stepbystep directions While Apple is late to the game with turnbyturn directions Forrester analyst Charles Golvin said that Apples new service featured various nice touches demonstrating Apples ability to take an experience offered by rivals and go even further He also cited a new app for iPhone and iPads called Passbook that organizes a users electronic airline tickets movie tickets and restaurant loyalty cards The app is a harbinger of them doing much much more said Golvin pointing to the electronic payment and mobile commerce market Finally executives said Apple has integrated No 1 social network Facebook deeper into the operating system allowing Siriusers to post photos with voice commands THE EDGE Long lines marked the beginning of the weeklong annual Worldwide Developers Conference where Apple developers rub shoulders with employees test the latest products and software and connect with peers Apple kicked off proceedings by touting its hardware its biggest edge over Google The consumer device giant introduced an allnew addition to its MacBook Pro lineup Apples highestend laptops At 07 inches and weighing under 45 pounds the new MacBook Pro ranks among the thinnest laptops in the market and will hit store shelves months before many Microsoft Windowsequipped Ultrabooks They will employ the retina displays that have won strong positive reviews for the new iPad but start at 2199 Along with the introduction of the new MacBook Pro Apple also updated it current Mac lineup including the MacBook Air Marketing chief Phil Schiller outlined how the redesigned MacBook Air notebooks will be about 100 cheaper on average than predecessors but sport quicker Intel Corp processors potentially eating into territory staked out by HewlettPackard Dell Inc and other PC makers Analysts have speculated that the company will begin aggressively competing on price gradually shrinking the premium its Macs carry in general More than ever Apple finds itself in a pitched battle with Google in smartphones cloud computing and a neverending competition to attract the best software developers That is crucial as Apple looks to draw users deeper into its applications ecosystem Cook told the audience that customers have downloaded more than 30 billion Apple apps so far choosing from more than 650000 apps  the largest library in the industry Battling in

566,Apple,6/11/2012,Apple expected to unveil applications to take on Google,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  When Apple Inc kicks off its annual conference for software developers on Monday all the power players in the Apple universe will be on hand save the one that is in many ways driving the agenda Google Inc   More than ever the consumer electronics juggernaut finds itself in a pitched battle with the online search giant  in smartphones cloud computing and the neverending competition for the hearts and minds of the best software developers Apple on Monday is expected to announce its own mapping application challenging the position of Google Maps as one of the mostvalued features on the iPhone It will unveil closer integration of its iPhone apps and iCloud storage service with all its devices the latest riposte in its battle with Googles Android smartphone software It may promote the latest in Siri the voice interface that the company thinks can continue to set the iPhone and the iPad apart from the Android pack And there will likely be a new line of Macintosh laptops too  underscoring the leverage that a full line of hardware products can bring to what is mainly a software war with Google Apple is looking to differentiate its mobile devices from Googles Android by further enticing consumers deeper into its app ecosystem said Carolina Milanesi analyst at Gartner Research Its all about loyalty and basically leveraging the opportunity of selling more to them she said I dont think the consumers in the mass market are necessarily tied into the Android ecosystem in the same way that consumers on the Apple side are Battling in many arenas the rivals employ different weapons Apples viselike grip on its ecosystem  with the closely managed app store and its seamless

potent hardware rivals to Apple Samsung Electronics Androiddriven Galaxy SIII is drawing favorable comparisons to iPhone and Amazoncom Incs cheaper Kindle Fire is challenging Apple in tablets and digital content Apples expected move to replace Google Maps with its own mapping application is a particularly dramatic example of how the rivalry between the companies has been evolving Google has invested huge sums in its mapping technology over the years and about half of its map traffic now comes from iPhones and iPads Among other things the traffic from those devices reveals valuable location data that helps improve the mapping service and provides features like realtime traffic reports Apple has spent three years preparing to take mapping back It has integrated technology from acquisitions such as 3D mapping company C3 Technologies Canadian startup Poly9 Group and mapping service Placebase said ISI analyst Brian Marshall As Apple builds out its Siri service they build out the iCloud infrastructure and more capability into its operating system location data is going to become important said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu This could help their advertising business too MULTIPRONGED BATTLE In what was seen as a preemptive move against Apples upcoming maps service Google on Wednesday showed off its own mapping capabilities including soontobelaunched 3D features While Google executives avoided any comment on the possibility of being ousted as a default service on Apple devices one executive said the integration with Googles search engine provides a mapping service that is far more useful than a product that simply uses a geocoder Apple began to use its own geocoder  technology that uses geographic coordinates to create a digital map  for the Googlebased maps on its smartphones late last year a move that was seen as a precursor to Apple using its own map software Another software upgrade that fans and developers are hoping for is Siri a popular voiceenabled personal assistant service that Google has yet to match The service could come out of its beta testing phase and show up on the iPad when Apple unveils iOS6 or the next version of its mobile operating software Siri which has been plagued with connectivity and other issues is still in beta test version Apples global war on Google and Android in the courts is one sign of how seriously it is taking the potential threat The consumer device giant is seeing limited success though in courtrooms for various patent infringement cases it has against Android manufacturers Apple said this week it is mulling a legal order to stop the US launch of Samsung Galaxy S III phone later this month Samsung is one of the biggest Android phone manufacturers In another of the many lawsuits worldwide pitting Apple against Motorola Mobility now owned by Google a federal judge canceled a scheduled trial as neither could prove damages That decision particularly hurts Apple because the iPhone maker was seeking an injunction barring the sale of Android products said Brian Love a professor at Stanford Law School The Android side is likely thrilled to simply have the case go away Love said Apple declined to comment on the case MACBOOK REDESIGN IN THE WORKS Where Apple has the upper hand is in its hardware  groundbreaking in design vastly popular with consumers for its ease of use The redesigned MacBook laptops to hit the stage next week are expected to include highdefinition screens and Intel Corps Ivy Bridge cuttingedge processors Some even expect the iPads retina display to show up on the MacBook line This would be Apples first big redesign of the MacBook Pro since mid2009 With the new lineup it hopes to fend off budding competition from rival manufacturers who are pushing a

percent sequentially Whatever the case Apple fans and partners can look forward to a fairly actionpacked week Apple is very serious about getting far in front of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks said Barclays

567,Apple,6/12/2012,Apple's Siri gets behind the wheel. Who should worry?,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple is taking Siri on the road   As the consumer device maker doubles down on its popular voiceenabled personal assistant software it is looking at another large market to drive rapid adoption cars Apple Incs new inhouse Maps service along with free turnbyturn navigation feature and realtime traffic updates converts the iPhone into a valuable navigation device  one of the most popular features on Google Incs Android gadgets Combine that with the new Eyes Free feature  where drivers talk to Siri with the tap of a button on steering wheels  and analysts say the iPhone has the potential to disrupt the car electronics and navigation market Using smartphones for directions and music is not new Incar navigation systems have been on a steady decline as more and more drivers prefer to use the mapping service in smartphones particularly Google maps Apples move to lend its technology might to connect the car to its iPhone in an easy to use manner could give a big boost to the adoption of Siri and further entice consumers deeper into its app ecosystem It makes the iPhones more valuable to the user said Mark Boyadjis infotainment analyst with IHS Automotive To be able to access it hands free and eyes free in the car will be an asset and will enable the Apple device to be continually more relevant in the car he said This is an important movement forward The integration is a winwin for both the carmaker and Apple said Scott Corwin vice president of Booz  Cos automotive practice The manufacturers are tying themselves to something that has a very positive impression with customers he said For Apple it helps to solidify market leadership with this technology Apple tweaked several features in its mobile operating system on Monday enhancing its ecosystem and bolstering its arsenal as it tries to keep its hardware ahead of competition from Googles Android device makers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd The rivalry is shaping the evolution of the mobile industry with the two companies  once friendly  increasingly challenging the other in various sectors including maps voiceenabled search apps and digital content The shares of Harman International Industries Inc known for its audio devices fell as much as 10 percent on Tuesday after Apple outlined plans to make Siri available in cars The shares of rivals such as navigation system maker Garmin Inc and TeleNav Incs also fell in tandem Vehicle navigation systems maker TomTom NV bucked the trend with a 15 percent rise as it struck a deal to license its maps to Apple The market for socalled auto infotainment technology  everything from navigation and audio systems to screens to chips  is sizable Revenue this year is projected to surge to 335 billion and growth will be even stronger in the next four years ranging from 47 percent to 64 percent according to IHS iSuppli DOWN BUT NOT OUT Already nine automakers  including Audi BMW AG General Motors Co Honda Motor Co Ltd Mercedes and Toyota Motor Corp  have signed up to buildin Apples Siri button on the steering wheel or dashboard in the next 12 months The button will allow drivers to access their iPhones to call people play music hear and dictate text messages ask for directions find calendar information and more But while Apples move is a serious threat both automakers and analysts said it does not spell the end for incar navigation and entertainment systems Automakers will be loathe to give up complete control of incar internet access to phone manufacturers given they are worried and liable for driver distraction analysts said Also the embedded system suppliers such as Harman have been working to diversify with consumers increasingly opting for free or cheap navigation software Harman Telenav  what they are supplying to the car is a combination of voice input offboard search and screenbased output which is much more than what this integration with Siri is going to be Boyadjis said The 10 percent drop that some of these companies experienced in the market today might be a little bit of an over reaction Audi one of the carmakers that is working with Apple sees Siri on the steering wheel as an experiment We are working with them to see how it would work but we dont have anything concrete yet to report Audi spokesman Brad Stertz said I dont think its going disrupt or stop other efforts to pull together more unified navigationinfotainment systems GM will be offering the service initially in its entry level vehicles Chevrolet Sonic subcompact and Chevy Spark minicar after having found that 70 percent of all newcar buyers want some form of connectivity in their vehicles But GM also has a smartphone app called GoGo Link  for 50  made by South Korean firm EnGIS Technology that connects any smartphone navigation system onto the cars dashboard screen providing internet connectivity to the car In this application the iPhone appears to be designed to complement existing infotainment offerings Baird analyst David Leiker said This does however underscore our view that integration of smartphones into vehicles is the greatest risk to embedded

568,Apple,6/12/2012,Analysis: Apple's big enemy in smartphone wars: delay,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc has spent nearly three years fighting its rivals in a global smartphone patent war Now setbacks in two key US court cases are laying bare why a drawnout battle could be bad news for the iPhone maker   Last Thursday Judge Richard Posner in Chicago federal court canceled Apples longawaited trial against Google Incs Motorola Mobility division which makes devices powered by the Internet search companys Android mobile operating system The trial had been set to start this week Then in an order late on Monday US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose California effectively dashed Apples hopes of stopping the launch of Samsung Electronics Co Ltds new Galaxy S III smartphone which also runs on Android Koh had said Apples push to get a court order blocking the June 21 launch would overload her calendar given Apples highstakes trial over other Samsung devices set for July that she is overseeing The latest decisions dont doom Apples courtroom efforts  the company can appeal Posners ruling while Kohs directive had nothing to do with the merits of the Samsung case about to go to trial or the legal arguments for an injunction on the new Samsung smartphone But delays in moving its cases through the courts is a blow to Apples efforts to get quick and favorable rulings that it hopes would give it an edge in the marketplace for mobile devices Apple has waged the international patent war since 2010 part of its attempt to limit growth of Android which last year established its dominance as the worlds bestselling mobile operating platform Apples opponents meanwhile say the iPhone maker is trying to use patents to avoid competing solely in the market A clear victory in one of the US legal cases could strengthen Apples hand in negotiating crosslicensing deals outside court where companies agree to let each other use their patented technologies The stalemate is much more of a victory for the accused infringers than it is for Apple said Brian Love a professor at Stanford Law School who studies patent litigation Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet reiterated a previous statement saying the blatant copying of its devices was wrong Google spokesman Jim Prosser said the rise of patent litigation is due to too many vague software patents and that Googles success makes it an attractive target A Samsung representative declined to comment Apple is not the only smartphone combatant that has faced setbacks in litigation over its technology Last month Oracle Corp came up empty in a trial against Google a case where Oracles damages estimates ranged up to 6 billion US District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco rejected Oracles copyright claims on parts of the Java programming language The enterprise software company said it would appeal LAND GRAB Apple is in a pitched battle with its competitors over who can develop the most innovative smartphone features In an attempt to help keep Android at bay the company announced new features for its voiceactivated Siri software at its annual developers conference on Monday The companys first lawsuit in its global patent fight was against smaller competitor HTC Corp in a Delaware federal court in March 2010 Apple also filed an action against HTC before a US trade panel which has forced delays in sales of some HTC smartphones Michael Yoshikami chief executive of Destination Wealth Management says HTC stock has suffered due to adverse court rulings But for a larger player like Apple the patent battle is important but not for its share price Rather it is used for a shortterm edge in the land grab for smartphone and tablet sales said Yoshikami whose fund holds Apple shares In a move that was widely seen as a preemptive strike against an imminent Apple lawsuit Motorola sued Apple in October 2010 in Chicago and Apple filed its own claims against Motorola the same month That case landed before Posner who issued a series of pretrial rulings that eliminated nearly all of Motorolas patent claims against Apple from the prospective trial while maintaining more of Apples claims against Motorola That meant Apple had more to gain in the trial which was set to start on Monday But in an order last week Posner scrapped the trial after finding that neither side could prove damages Apple had sought an injunction barring the sale of Motorola products but Posner said that would be contrary to the public interest Nick Rodelli a lawyer and adviser to institutional investors for CFRA Research in Maryland rated Posners decision an incremental negative for Apple However Rodelli doesnt think it will stand up on appeal saying in part that Posner improperly denied Apple a hearing on its right to an injunction Yet Stanfords Professor Love said that Posners ruling and the delay it causes in Apple getting the case to trial even if it wins an appeal will reduce Apples leverage during any potential licensing talks In the Samsung lawsuit filed last year in California the iPhone maker says Samsung slavishly copied the iPhone and iPad Samsung denies the claims and countersued The trial centers around Apples claims against multiple Samsung phones as well as a Galaxy tablet But those products are not the most pressing worry for Apple at the moment Samsungs Galaxy S III phone is set to launch in the US on June 21 and Apple fears blockbuster sales But courts dont move as quickly as new technology At a court hearing last week Apple attorney Josh Krevitt complained that Samsung is able to release new phones before the legal system has time to address their patent violations Samsung is always one step ahead launching another product and another product Krevitt said Koh last week said Apple could ask for a temporary restraining order against the Galaxy S III phone but that would likely delay the trial over a Galaxy tablet and other smartphones In her order on Monday the judge said Apple would have to request a new hearing date if it wanted to stop sales of the Galaxy S III phone That likely would not take place before the phones scheduled launch Apple has not said what its next move will be Courtordered mediation between the CEOs of Apple and Samsung did not produce a settlement in the wideranging litigation Barring a last minute agreement the trial is slated for July 30 Apple cannot afford to get bogged down in its global legal campaign against Android said Paul Berghoff a Chicagobased patent attorney with McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert

583,Apple,7/24/2012,Apple heads into choppy waters as new iPhone awaited,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc faces an unusual phenomenon when reporting earnings this time around low expectations   Few are expecting the worlds most valuable technology company  which surpasses Wall Street expectations with near regularity  to deliver a bumper quarter once more on Tuesday The main reason consumers holding out for the new iPhone Apple may still surprise market watchers but many Wall Street analysts and investors remember how chatter over the launch of a new iPhone last year caused Apple to miss quarterly expectations in the fall for the first time in years The iPhone 5 is only expected to hit store shelves around October  just in time for the holidays  with a thinner larger screen and finetuned search features Couple that prelaunch lull with slowdowns in Europe and China Apples biggest markets outside of North America and sentiment on the Wall Street darling is more muted than many can remember in a while No longer is Apple the company that beats every time said Tim Lesko portfolio manager at Granite Investment Advisors which owns Apple stock I expect Apple to beat Apples guidance but I dont know whether they will beat Wall Streets guidance Tony Sacconaghi analyst with Bernstein Research sees a reasonable chance Apple will miss expectations on revenue citing macroeconomic weakness in China and Europe a product cycle lull in the iPhone a later than expected introduction of the new iPad into China and the late quarter introduction of new Mac notebooks Any hiccup in demand for the bestselling smartphone can have a big impact on both revenue and profits as the fiveyear old device accounts for nearly 50 percent for Apples revenues And it comes at a time Samsung and other manufacturers that use rival Google Incs Android software are chipping away at its market share Apple is expected to report fiscal thirdquarter earnings of 1035 a share on revenue of 372 billion according to Thomson Reuters IBES Top Wall Street analysts are betting the numbers will undershoot that Apple may miss the average sales forecast by about 02 percent according to Thomson Reuters Starmines SmartEstimates which places greater emphasis on timely forecasts by toprated analysts IPADS LAUNCH IN CHINA But some analysts also think the Street is underestimating the impact of a late iPad launch in China a focal point of intense expansion for the company and a huge driver of growth Apple began selling the tablet there on Friday but many had expected it to ship last quarter Sales in China Hong Kong and Taiwan jumped threefold to 79 billion in the second quarter accounting for about 20 percent of Apples 392 billion in total revenue The company typically introduces a new iPhone every year but has yet to reveal any details on the next model However people familiar with the situation have told Reuters the new iPhone will have a bigger display and that Apple has begun to place orders for the new displays from suppliers in South Korea and Japan Meanwhile Apples iPhone 4S is just three quarters old which is relatively new by any standard But many fans of the phone now see it as a cyclical product with somewhat predictable launch timeframes preferring to wait a few months to buy the new model analysts said Wall Street estimates Apple sold about 29 million iPhones down from 351 million sold in the March quarter Sales of the new iPad expected to be 14 million to 15 million is likely to offset part of the anticipated sequential drop in iPhones sales Apart from concerns about iPhone purchases Wall Street is worried about the rising prominence of Google and Amazoncom in the mobile market particularly with the launch of Googles smaller and cheaper Nexus 7 tablet which is gaining popularity Still no one is bearish in the longer term on the worlds largest technology company by market value and most Apple watchers believe the company will make up any lost iPhone volume during the holiday season Big picture it doesnt matter said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu They are still the share gainer in the larger scheme of things This is clearly a timing issue BIG HOLIDAY SEASON EYED Wall Street expects that the outlook for this years holiday season will be enormous for Apple as it may include the launch of a new iPhone as well as a potential new mini iPad Apple has been working on a smaller tablet a person familiar with the matter told Reuters It is unclear when Apple will launch such a tablet but some clues are emerging on the timing of the new iPhone When Verizon  one of the wireless carriers that work with Apple  was asked on Thursday why customers have been holding back on handset upgrades CFO Fran Shammo said There is always that rumor mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter and so people may be waiting Investors will pick apart executives comments for clues to new product introductions While Apple has a policy of never giving advance details or timings on new products Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer has often hinted of product transition in earnings conference calls preceding a launch Wall Street estimates Apple sold about 4 million Macintosh computers as the PC market saw growth sputter in the quarter The lackluster expectations do not appear to have affected Apples stock which is up nearly 50 percent so far in 2012 The stock has been choppy since a high of 644 in April It closed Friday at 60430 on the Nasdaq Of all the quarters this is the one that seems to have widest range of opinion

592,Apple,7/26/2012,Apple's invincibility fades on iPhone miss global woes,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Incs biggest success has become its biggest risk factor   The iPhone revolutionized the smartphone industry driving Apples expansion into Europe and China and after just half a decade yields about half its annual 100 billion revenue haul But the worlds most valuable technology company  which throughout the global recession nearunfailingly smashed Wall Street forecasts  is beginning to lose its aura of invincibility The company has missed Wall Street targets twice in under a year CEO Tim Cook may now have to worry more about economic and product launch cycles and the whims of fickle consumers Tuesdays numbers also showed the impact of the economic slowdown in Europe on its sales something a smaller lessexposed Apple was able to dodge a few years ago Apple is a little bit more vulnerable said Giri Cherukuri head trader at OakBrook Investments There are chinks in their armor now The reason for its vulnerability its very success and size When they were small enough they could power through it Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said Now its so pervasive that its a lot harder The change in sentiment was evident in Cooks call with investors on Tuesday following a miss in fiscal third quarter earnings numbers Cook assessed how the global economy  particularly in Italy France Greece and China  impacted iPhone sales This stood in stark contrast to his comments in 2009 when the worlds credit system froze and global economy was grinding to a halt in the aftermath of Lehman Bros collapse We just spend our time projecting our business and leave the economy forecasting and comments to economists Cook said during an earnings conference call nearly three years ago  before the launch of the iPad and when the Mac computer generated more revenue than the iPhone On Tuesday Cook was somewhat more expansive in his assessment of the business environment We are certainly seeing a slowdown in business in that area Cook said of Western Europe Fortunately the US and China although I realize its getting a lot of press were not seeing anything there that we would classify as an obvious economic issue BRANDING SHEEN The blockbuster smartphone that adds a special gloss to the Apple brand is a highly cyclical product Buyers emerge in droves every time a new version is launched lining up at stores overnight and snarling supply for the device Its popularity has heightened speculation around the device every year as over 100 million yearly customers decide when to switch to a new model whether to buy now or hold out for a better but samepriced phone The nowmore predictable lineup also means consumers are more attuned to product life cycles and launch timelines something that Apple goes to great lengths to keep secret In fiscal 2009 Apple grew 35 percent despite a global credit crisis that hurt most companies But Apple generated only 675 billion from iPhones that year It raked in over 16 billion in iPhone sales last quarter alone a little under half of total revenue When you become so reliant on a single device then that devices life cycle is going to have a much bigger impact on the results Morningstar analyst Michael Holt said Sales of the iPhone slipped 26 percent sequentially last quarter reducing margins by 460 basis points to 428 percent Investors had already lowered their expectations but they did not expect the company to miss altogether A lot of the blame was placed on the pause prior to the launch of a new iPhone which some fear is becoming a yearly trend We expect to see greater volatility in Apples quarterly results going forward due to the growing importance of the product cycle Holt said adding that more consumers now are tuning into the chatter around expected new products Thats prompted Wall Street to take Apples notoriously conservative earnings forecast more seriously now On Wednesday JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to 675 from 695 Raymond James slashed it to 730 from 800 and Canaccord Genuity reduced its target slightly to 797 Goldman cut its price target to 790 from 850 Finally as consumers await the new iPhone  expected to be a complete redesign with a bigger screen  competition is growing from the likes of Samsung Electronics new Galaxy S III But analysts and investors say that the choppiness in iPhone sales doesnt matter as long as Apples strong growth resumes during the holiday quarter after the anticipated new iPhone hits the stores Expectations are high that Apple will launch a phone that will again beat the competition in terms of features And the bullish view of Apples growth is evident in the stock price which is up 42 percent for the year despite a 43 percent drop on Wednesday on the Nasdaq market This is likely one of the last buying opportunities ahead of the iPhone 5 launch as we expect headwinds to reverse in the calendar fourth quarter Morgan Stanleys

594,Apple,7/27/2012,Apple Samsung take patent fight to crucial California trial,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd take their battle for mobile supremacy to court on Monday in one of the biggestever technology patent trials a case with the potential to reshape a fastevolving market they now dominate   The tech titans will lock horns in a federal courtroom in San Jose California just miles from Apples headquarters The stakes are high with Samsung facing potential US sales bans of its Galaxy smartphones and tablet computers and Apple in a pivotal test of its worldwide patent litigation strategy Both sides are seeking financial damages from the other Samsung has rapidly overtaken Apple creator of the iPhone and iPad and Nokia to become the worlds largest smartphone maker Together Apple and Samsung account for more than half of smartphone sales globally Apple sued Samsung last year in San Jose claiming its smartphones and tablets slavishly copied the iPhone and iPad The South Korean company countersued Since then the two have expanded their fight to courtrooms in nearly a dozen other countries At this trial Apple is seeking at least 253 billion in damages though US District Judge Lucy Koh could triple that figure if she finds Samsung willfully infringed Apples patents The dispute has reached deep into the tech sector with companies including Microsoft Corp IBM Corp Nokia and Research in Motion Ltd filing court papers this week to try to keep their own patent licensing agreements from being disclosed during the trial A loss for Samsung could lead to permanent sales bans against products including the flagship Galaxy S III phone said Nick Rodelli a lawyer and adviser to institutional investors for CFRA Research in Maryland While the S III is not at issue in the trial if Apple prevails the company could later ask Koh to block sales of that product Upward of 20 percent of Samsungs global consolidated profit could be affected if it loses this case he said Samsung is a big company with operations all over the world but this is actually a needlemover for them on the bottom line Rodelli said Apple will try to use Samsung documents to show its rival knowingly violated the iPhone makers intellectual property rights while Samsung argues Apple is trying to stifle competition to maintain exorbitant profit In a statement Friday Samsung said Apple has been freeriding on its technology while using excessive legal claims against our products in their attempt to limit consumer choice and discourage innovation An Apple spokesman reiterated the companys previous statement that it wasnt a coincidence Samsungs latest products looked a lot like the iPhone and iPad and that Samsung blatantly copied its products A loss for Apple could be significant not only if it were ordered to pay financial damages but also because of the competitive threats That is because the Galaxy S III is a better phone than the latest iPhone 4S said Michael Yoshikami chief executive of Destination Wealth Management Apple is all about slowing Samsung down said Yoshikami whose fund holds Apple shares Apple will try to buy time until iPhone 5 launches which is expected in October Apple shipped 26 million iPhones in the quarter ended in June fewer than in the previous quarter and well below the 28 million to 29 million that Wall Street had predicted Samsung is estimated to have increased sales to around 50 million smartphones That helped the South Korean giant to report a record quarterly profit of 59 billion on Friday FINANCIAL DATA COMES TO LIGHT In the past few days the companies have supplied some detailed financial data in court filings such as a disclosure on Thursday that Apples gross margins for its iPads are about half of those for the iPhones The information was included in newly unsealed papers and was not previously known giving Wall Street a rare glimpse into Apples financial breakdown for specific products The companies had initially sought to keep many documents from public view but Judge Koh rejected the bulk of the requests on July 17 Her order came hours after Reuters filed court papers opposing the companies efforts to seal the documents The lawyers on both sides are well known Apple is represented by law firm Morrison  Foerster which led Oracle Corps patent case against Google Inc earlier this year over the Android operating system Samsung whose products run on Android hired lawyers from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan which also represents Google and which led Yahoo Incs shortlived patent lawsuit against Facebook this year A 10member jury will hear evidence over at least four weeks and it must reach a unanimous decision for Apple or Samsung to prevail on any of their claims Apple says Samsung violated four of its design patents which cover the look and feel of its products It also says Samsung has infringed three patents for technology such as how the phone distinguishes between scroll and multitouch gestures Meanwhile Samsung says Apple violated patents on mobile communications systems as well as features like taking a photo on a phone and seamlessly emailing it In a lastditch attempt to avoid a trial Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and Samsung Vice Chairman Choi Geesung participated in a mediation on July 16 But a settlement prior to trial is unlikely sources have told Reuters It has been tough going so far for Samsung in the case Koh halted US sales of the Galaxy Tab 101 giving Apple a significant early win This was followed by a pretrial ban on the Galaxy Nexus phone Samsung has appealed both orders The stakes for Apple are also high due to competitive threats from other Asian phone makers such as Chinas Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Rodelli said Its arguably the most commercially and doctrinally significant US patent case in the modern era he said The case in US District Court Northern District of California is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co

595,Apple,7/27/2012,Apple buys mobile security firm AuthenTec for $356 million,1, Reuters  Apple Inc  AAPLO  will buy fingerprint sensor technology developer AuthenTec Inc AUTHO for about 356 million striking a deal that could put its iPhone at the center of the emerging mobile payments market   Shares of AuthenTec whose sensor chips can be used in personal computers and mobile devices closed above the 8 per share that Apple agreed to pay for the company suggesting some investors expect a rival bid Apple is paying a 58 percent premium for the Melbourne Floridabased AuthenTec which counts Korean mobile device maker  and fierce Apple rival  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  005930KS  among its biggest customers AuthenTec is one of the very few public companies that Apple has acquired The worlds most valuable technology company rarely does acquisitions and tends to buy mostly startups when looking for cuttingedge technology AuthenTec spun off from Harris Semiconductor in 1998 and which went public in 2007 provides mobile security software licenses to companies like Samsung and fingerprint sensor technology to computer makers such as HewlettPackard Co  HPQN  and Dell Inc DELLO Its fingerprint technology used in mobile phones in Japan for authentication of mobile payments could help Apple bring those services to markets such as the United States where mobilewallet services have been slow to catch on Shares of AuthenTec surged 335 or 66 percent to 842 on Nasdaq Apple stock closed up 1028 to 58516 BSW Financial analyst Hameed Khorsand said the offer price was not high enough to keep competing bids at bay and the California mobile giant is validating AuthenTecs technology with its interest There could be other parties interested in taking a serious look at purchasing AuthenTec he said If not for the technology AuthenTec owns then for forcing Apple to pay up Analysts see Google Inc  GOOGO  and Samsung as potential rival bidders The terms of the deal do not permit AuthenTec to shop for offers but does allow it to consider unsolicited bids Piper Jaffray advised in the deal The company has agreed to inform Apple if it receives any inquiries or offers Apple has to pay a termination fee of 20 million in case the deal does not close because of antitrust issues If AuthenTec goes for a higher rival bid it will have to pay Apple 1095 million APPLE ALSO ACQUIRING PATENTS AuthenTec which also counts Lenovo Group Ltd  0992HK  and Fujitsu Ltd  6702T  as customers has annual revenue of about 70 million and has itself been acquiring companies that would help in building a host of mobile security products In the past 5 years the growth of iPhone and Android smartphones has made mobile data security essential not just a nicetohave feature said Ben Yu Managing Director of Sierra Ventures one of the early investors in AuthenTec People have their whole lives on the phones AuthenTecs embedded fingerprint scanners and other identityrelated software is particularly useful now that Near Field Communications or NFCenabled phones have begun to appear in the market he added At the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas this week security experts demonstrated ways to attack Android smartphones using NFC The technology allows users to share photos with friends make payments or exchange data simply by bringing phones within a few centimeters of similarly equipped devices such as another phone or a payment terminal An Apple spokesman declined to comment on how Apple plans to use AuthenTecs technology Apple has also acquired the right to pay the company to license certain patents totaling as much as 115 million It will also pay AuthenTec 75 million for some product development work The exact nature of the work was not disclosed but the agreement filed with regulators hinted at the development of a 2D fingerprint sensor for Apple that is suitable for use in an Apple product Some analysts expect the next version of the iPhone to include some form of mobile payments technology Apple will debut in the fall its Passbook software a mobile app for storing tickets coupons and loyalty cards Passbook marks Apples entry in the mobile payment space an area that requires topnotch embedded security While companies such as Google already have mobile payments offerings such services are not widely used in the United States and have been dogged by security concerns BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said AuthenTec technology could potentially also help Apple combat problems such as theft of its more portable products such as iPhones If they could have a way where they could tie the phone to a user more tightly that would make sense for them he said He described the price tag for AuthenTec as a drop in the bucket of Apples cash pile of 1172 billion and noted the company had not been as acquisitive as other technology firms Well see if its a oneoff or if Tim Cook will start to level his cash balance and acquire talent Gillis said

600,Apple,8/3/2012,Apple's Jobs was open to making smaller iPad: executive,1, SAN JOSE California  Reuters  Steve Jobs was receptive to Apple Inc making a smaller tablet a senior executive said in a 2011 email revealed on Friday fanning speculation that Apple plans to make a miniiPad and take on Google and Amazon products   Vice President Eddy Cue urged thenchief operating officer Tim Cook in January 2011 to build a 7inch tablet according to an email from Cue that Samsung Electronics introduced as evidence in a US patent trial In an email addressed also to software chief Scott Forstall and marketing head Phil Schiller Cue said he believed there was a market for a 7inch tablet and that we should do one Speculation intensified in 2012 that Apple is preparing to launch a 7inch version of the marketdominating 10inch iPad to counter increasing inroads made by smaller tablets such as the Kindle Fire and most recently Googles Nexus 7 But the company has never confirmed such talk The email was introduced on Friday as an exhibit in a highwattage trial being played out in San Jose this summer before much of the technology industry Apple and Samsung are going toetotoe in a patent dispute that mirrors a global struggle for industry supremacy between two rivals that together control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales Apple accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone and is asking for billions of dollars in damages and a sales ban The Korean company which is trying to expand in the US market accuses Apple of infringing on some of its key wireless technology patents Cue who rose to prominence overseeing the iTunes and Apps stores became the companys senior vice president of Internet software and services in September Cue said in an email dated January 24 2011 he had broached the idea of a smaller tablet to Jobs several times since Thanksgiving and the cofounder was receptive the last time That appeared to run counter to Jobs publicly expressed dislike of smaller tablets In late 2010 Jobs told analysts on a conference call that 7inch tablets should come with sandpaper so users could file their fingers down to a quarter of their size There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap flick or pinch them Jobs who died in October after a yearslong battle with cancer said at the time This is one of the key reasons we think the 10inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet Apps COURT FIREWORKS Earlier on Friday marketing chief Phil Schiller told a jampacked courtroom on Friday that Apples strategy in maintaining its market momentum is to make the product the biggest and clearest thing in advertising The 15year Apple veteran told the jury the company has spent a total of about 647 million on advertising for the iPhone launched in 2007 and over 457 million for the twoyearold iPad Dressed in a dark suit and yellow tie Schiller  who favors blue jeans and is one of a handful of executives reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook  said Samsungs copying of Apples designs has hurt its sales and disrupted its marketing I was pretty shocked at the appearance of the Galaxy S phone and the extent it appeared to copy Apple products he told the jury adding that he was even more shocked when he saw the Galaxy tab I thought theyve done it again theyre just going to copy our whole product line Apple fans investors and rivals are getting a rare glimpse into the zealously guarded internal processes at a company that has won respect in the industry not just for its products but also its marketing savvy and streamline supply chain operation This week 17year industrial design veteran Christopher Stringer also gave a behindthescenes look at the hardware design process behind some of the worlds most celebrated consumer electronics such as the iPhone NO THEATRICS JUDGE WARNS Before Schiller took the stand on Friday US District Judge Lucy Koh rejected Apples request for severe sanctions against Samsung over the conduct of one of Samsungs attorneys even as the judge said that conduct risked tainting the jury A Samsung press statement earlier this week contained links to documents that Koh had ruled could not be admitted at trial along with a statement that fundamental fairness requires that the jury decide the case based on all the evidence Samsung attorney John Quinn of the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan acknowledged in a court filing that he authorized the press statement but said it was not designed to influence the jury Apple had asked Koh to punish Samsung by ruling that Apples phone design patents were valid and infringed In court on Friday Koh rejected that request but said there may be more investigation of the events after the trial I will not let any theatrics or any sideshows distract us from what we are here to do Koh said Koh then brought in members of the ninemember jury one at a time to ask if they had read anything about the case since Tuesday One juror said he had read Internet headlines but not the articles and all said they could

of the worlds iPads and iPhones according to auditors the firms enlisted to monitor the process but tough tasks lie ahead   The Fair Labor Association said on Tuesday local laws require the companies  which came under fire over conditions at the plants blamed for a series of suicides in 2010  to reduce hours by almost a third by 2013 for the hundreds of thousands working in Foxconn plants across southern China Foxconn said on Wednesday it would continue to cut overtime to less than nine hours a week from the current 20 even though that could raise labor costs while also making it difficult to attract workers It is a challenge When we reduce overtime it means we need to hire more people and implement more automation more investment on robotic engineering More workers also mean more dormitories and recreational facilities it takes time said Louis Woo special assistant to the CEO of Foxconn But I expect more loyalty from workers as a result and then we can save more costs on recruitment and retainment he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday Yield rates will also improve Efficiency in terms of productivity yield gain retention and lower turnover rates should be able to improve next year Earlier this year the FLA  of which Apple is a member  found multiple violations of labor law including extreme hours after launching one of the largest investigations ever conducted of an American companys operations outside the United States Apple the worlds most valuable company and Foxconn  the trading name of Taiwans Hon Hai Precision Industry whose clients also include Dell Inc Sony Corp and HewlettPackard Co  agreed to slash overtime improve safety hire new workers and upgrade dormitories Woo said Foxconn not only wants to do the right thing for its one million employees it also wants to serve as a model for other companies In a report tracking the progress of those commitments the FLA said it had verified that agreedupon changes had been instituted and that Apple was trying to hold its partner the worlds largest contract manufacturer accountable Auret van Heerden president and CEO of the FLA said Foxconn faces a challenge from workers expectations A lot of workers have clearly come to Shenzhen to make as much money as they can in as short a period as they can and overtime hours are very important in that calculation he said We are picking up concerns now on the microblogs about whats likely to happen as hours gets changed and whether their incomes will be shaved as well Many people would leave Foxconn if there is no overtime according to a post by Shenzhen Mars on Chinas Twitterlike Weibocom message system Foxconns Woo said the company has been constantly telling workers about the importance of the quality of life and health This is the thing we need to continue to communicate with workers especially young migrant workers that anyone who works more than a certain number of hours will feel tired and not well If we can improve the work environment and benefits they can enjoy their life better At Foxconns massive factory in Shenzhens Longhua district six workers interviewed by Reuters said overtime hours had been cut to between 48 to 60 hours per month down from some 80 before Some said more workers were quitting Foxconn to seek better paid work elsewhere with red posters plastered on walls everywhere calling for largescale recruitment of replacements Staff were getting text messages offering bonuses for referring friends or relatives to the factory A lot of my friends have resigned said a production line worker surnamed Li From just my home town alone there have been at least ten people who have left On a basic level most workers were able to withstand the pressures of the previous overtime system But not everyone was unhappy Theres been an improvement in the past six months Its a bit more comfortable with shorter work days said spikyhaired worker Liu Xiaoguan But his takehome pay has dropped from around 3700 yuan 583 per month to 3000 yuan I hardly save anything he said with a laugh I like spending too much PROTESTS Global protests against Apple swelled after reports spread in 2010 about the suicides at Foxconn plants blamed on harsh working conditions and alienation felt by migrant laborers often from impoverished provinces in a bustling metropolis like Shenzhen which is home to two of the three factories the FLA inspected Apple has tried to counter criticism that its profits are built on the backs of mistreated Chinese workers The FLAs progress report comes a day after Apples market value climbed past 623 billion surpassing the record set by Microsoft Corp during the heyday of technology stocks in 1999 The latest report card on AppleFoxconn comes after first findings and a timeline for improvements were announced in March though some industry observers said the original agreement was not entirely independent because of close ties between the FLA and corporate members Since that March audit rights groups including China Labor Watch have conducted their own studies The group said in a statement on Wednesday that Foxconn workers were still unhappy and urged other Apple suppliers to be scrutinized as well Workers have to complete the workload of 66 hours before within 60 hours now per week As a result the workers get lower wages but have to work much harder and they are not satisfied with the current situation it said Apart from health and safety enhancements Foxconn is offering up a few enhancements to employee morale For instance Van Heerden said it is increasingly giving workers a choice of accommodation such as by providing an allowance for housing and food if the workers choose to live offsite Foreign companies have long grappled with working

609,Apple,8/22/2012,Analysis: In Apple vs. Samsung alchemy of damages takes the stage,1, SAN JOSE Calif  Reuters  Between the hotshot designers and brainy engineers Apple Inc questioned for three weeks in the companys bitterly fought patent battle against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd a marketing expert from MIT took Apples lawyers all of three minutes   But the testimony from MIT Professor John Hauser cuts to a central dilemma in the smartphone patent wars What is a single nifty feature worth Hausers answer exactly 39 per phone for a device that recognizes a second finger on the touchscreen If such features are deemed to be as valuable as Hauser suggests a verdict in Apple favors might represent more than just a big payout in damages It could also prompt the judge to award Apple a much bigger prize a sales ban on Samsung mobile products Nine jurors began deliberating Apples intellectual property claims against Samsung on Wednesday in a federal court in San Jose California If they decide Samsung which is the worlds largest smartphone maker violated any of Apples patents  or vice versa  the next question is how exactly each company should be made to pay The answer lies in the alchemy of estimating damages in high stakes intellectual property cases in which slight changes in assumptions are worth billions of dollars and individual judges vary widely on how they handle the testimony of paid expert witnesses Further complicating the issue is a recent appellate court ruling that threw out damages rules that had been on the books for decades In some ways were in uncharted territory here said Thomas Cotter a professor at University of Minnesota Law School who is not involved in the litigation Apple is seeking more than 25 billion and a sales ban based on small subset of features it claims are in great demand among consumers A verdict in Apples favor would put large swaths of the smartphone industry at risk of similar legal troubles SKEPTICAL JUDGES Apples arguments on the value of the market demand for its features are embodied in Hausers study which surveyed Samsung customers over the Internet It is a central pillar on which the iPhone makers damages case rests Some judges are skeptical of such surveys Earlier this year Judge Richard Posner in federal court in Chicago dismissed litigation between Apple and Googles Motorola Mobility unit after lambasting damages studies prepared by both sides In an interview with Reuters last month Posner distinguished between customer surveys conducted by companies in their normal course of developing products and those done for litigation Its a lot less credible Posner said In Apples battle against Samsung however swaths of expert damages testimony from both sides have been allowed into evidence Patent damages used to involve a principle known as the 25 percent rule if a company infringed a patent it risked paying 25 percent of its profits to the patent owner  regardless of how marginal the technology was to the overall product Critics blasted the rule for unfairly large awards and it was overturned last year The change gave rise to surveys like Hausers which attempt to move away from arbitrary percentages and tie patented features to real world consumer preferences said Roy Epstein a professional damages expert who has not worked for Apple or Samsung It is up to judges to decide which studies are fit for juries to see Posner believes those that focus the consumers attention on one technological feature to the exclusion of thousands of others can artificially exaggerate its importance In court filings unsealed during the runup to trial Hauser argued his study solves that problem by showing consumers different phones with varying features A multifeature task discourages respondents from guessing that the researcher is interested in a particular feature which would in turn cause the respondent to believe that the researcher is demanding a particular response Hauser wrote Samsung did not seek to bar Hausers testimony before trial and US District Court Judge Lucy Koh can consider it when mulling a permanent sales ban if the jury goes Apples way BACK TO THE MONEY Hauser believes smartphone users would be willing to pay 100 more for phones with multitouch and two other features Cue Apples key accounting expert Terry Musika based in part on Hausers findings Musika testified that Samsung should pay a royalty of 714 per phone on those three patents Combined with Apples design claims covering flourishes like rectangles with rounded corners  Musika gave the jury a scenario to award Apple a royalty of about 540 million That amount would not slow down a global tech purveyor like Samsung Musika also handed the jury another option to compute Samsungs tab based on the Korean companys profits an approach that would ramp up the potential payday Musika pegged Samsungs gross profit margins for the phones at issue in the lawsuit at 355 percent or more than 22 billion Judges are allowed to bar experts based on problems with their methods In Oracles copyright battle against Google for instance US District Court Judge William Alsup forced Oracle to rework its damages arguments more than once But while judges can bar an expert if they think his or her methods are bogus they are supposed to let jurors sort out the assumptions Samsungs expert Michael Wagner criticized Musika for failing to account for marketing RD and other costs that would reduce Samsungs profits Wagners scenario put Samsungs vulnerable profits at 519 million Patent damages expert Epstein said good experts only go so far when devising numbers for their clients I tell them Im perfectly happy to consider any damages theory but then I ask myself What questions does such an approach raise Epstein said If I dont have a principled answer theres a line beyond which you cant go The case in US District Court Northern District of California is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics

610,Apple,8/22/2012,Apple Samsung make final pitch to jury,1, SAN JOSE California  Reuters  Apple Incs worldwide legal crusade against the Android mobile operating system drew toward a climax on Tuesday as the iPhone makers attorneys accused Samsung of taking a shortcut by copying Apples designs after realizing it could not keep up   Closing arguments were delivered at trial between Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in a federal court in San Jose California The jury will begin deliberating on Wednesday Samsung attorney Charles Verhoeven countered by urging jurors to consider that a verdict in favor of Apple could stifle competition and reduce choices for consumers Rather than competing in the marketplace Apple is seeking a competitive edge in the courtroom Verhoeven said Apple thinks its entitled to having a monopoly on a rounded rectangle with a large screen Its amazing really Apple and Samsung are going toetotoe in a patents dispute that mirrors the struggle for industry supremacy between the two companies which control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales A win for Apple could have a major impact on the industry because the South Korean companys mobile products are run on Google Incs Android operating system popular software that is used by many other manufacturers Before he died Apple cofounder Steve Jobs told his biographer he intended to go thermonuclear on Android saying it had copied Apple If the jury determines Samsung violated Apples valid patents US District Judge Lucy Koh could impose sales bans against the Korean companys products In court on Tuesday Apple attorney Harold McElhinny urged jurors to consider the testimony of a South Korean designer who said she worked day and night on Samsungs phones for three months In those critical three months Samsung was able to copy and incorporate the result of Apples fouryear investment in hard work and ingenuity  without taking any of the risks McElhinny said Apple is seeking more than 25 billion in damages from Samsung An Apple expert said Samsung earned 355 percent margins on the tablets and phones at issue in the lawsuit from mid2010 through March 2012 on 816 billion in US revenue Samsung has disputed that figure Apple accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages Samsung which is trying to expand in the United States says Apple infringed several patents including some for its key wireless technology Both Apple and Samsung used a series of internal emails witness testimony from designers product demonstrations and mockups to present their case CROWD OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE McElhinny laid out what he said was chronological evidence that showed Samsung copied Apples designs He also told the jury that while Apple brought many of its top executives to testify and face cross examination Samsung had presented no major decision makers From the very beginning Samsung has disrespected this process he said McElhinny said Samsungs internal documents compared its products with Apples  and determined it had a crisis of design Scores of journalists lawyers analysts and observers turned out to watch the arguments By 730 am 1430 GMT on Tuesday the line outside the courthouse was nearly a block long The nine member jury spent over two hours listening to granular legal instructions before Apples McElhinny began his presentation just after lunch McElhinny focused on a meeting between Samsung and Google executives in February 2010 where Google asked Samsung to stop imitating the iPad so closely Samsung executives chose to ignore that demand and continue on the path of copying he said Apple said the products looked so similar that it led to confusion in the marketplace Samsungs Verhoeven said Apple had not shown any evidence that consumers were actually deceived into buying Samsung products instead of the iPhone or iPad Consumers make choices not mistakes he said Verhoeven also went on to tell the jury that Apples damages claims were not calculated correctly calling them ridiculous On rebuttal Apple attorney Bill Lee said Apple was not trying to keep Samsung out of the smartphone market All were saying is Make your own Lee said The trial which is in its fourth week has revealed details about the famously secretive maker of the iPhone and iPad some substantive and some just colorful Among the evidence were emails sent by Apples Internet services chief to top Apple executives urging them to consider a smaller iPad and indicating that Jobs was warming to the idea An Apple industrial designer described working around a kitchen table with his team to come up with the companys mobile products Its patent licensing director also said Microsoft Corp was one of the few companies to get a license for Apple design patents but only because Microsoft consented to an anticloning provision The case in US District Court

613,Apple,8/24/2012,Apple triumphs over Samsung in landmark patent case,1, SAN JOSE California  Reuters  Apple Inc scored a sweeping legal victory over Samsung on Friday as a US jury found the Korean company had copied critical features of the hugely popular iPhone and iPad and awarded the US company 105 billion in damages   The verdict  which came after less than three days of jury deliberations  could lead to an outright ban on sales of key Samsung products and will likely solidify Apples dominance of the exploding mobile computing market Apples victory is a big blow to Google whose Android software powers the Samsung products that were found to infringe on Apple patents Google and its hardware partners including the companys own Motorola unit could now face further legal hurdles in their effort to compete with the Apple juggernaut Samsung lawyers were grimfaced in the quiet but crowded San Jose courtroom as the verdict was read and the company later put out a statement calling the outcome a loss for the American consumer The jury deliberated for less than three days before delivering the verdict on seven Apple patent claims and five Samsung patent claims  suggesting that the nineperson panel had little difficulty in concluding that Samsung had copied the iPhone and the iPad Because the panel found willful infringement Apple could seek triple damages Apple upended the mobile phone business when it introduced the iPhone in 2007 and shook the industry again in 2010 when it rolled out the iPad It has been able to charge premium prices for the iPhone  with profit margins of as much as 58 percent per phone  for a product consumers regarded as a huge advance in design and usability The companys late founder Steve Jobs vowed to go to thermonuclear war when Google launched Android according to his biographer and the company has filed lawsuits around the world in an effort to block what it considers brazen copying of its inventions The legal win on Friday came one year after CEO Tim Cook assumed the helm of the company Shares in Apple which just this week became the biggest company by market value in history climbed almost 2 percent to a record high of 675 in afterhours trade Brian Love a Santa Clara law school professor described the verdict as a crushing victory for Apple This is the bestcase scenario Apple could have hoped for CHALLENGE FOR COMPETITORS The verdict comes as competition in the mobile device industry intensifies with Google jumping into hardware for the first time with its Nexus 7 tablet and Microsofts new touchscreen friendly Windows 8 coming in October led by its Surface tablet Apples victory could present immediate issues for companies that sell Androidbased smartphones and tablets including Googles own Motorola subsidiary which it acquired last year for 125 billion and HTC of Taiwan Amazon  which has made major inroads into the tablet market with its cheaper Kindle Fire  uses a modified version of Android for its Kindle products but has not yet been subject to legal challenge by Apple Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said the entire Android universe may now have to consider doing something different It doesnt take a rocket scientist to look at it and figure it out he said Prior to the iPhone none of the phones were like that Android if you look at it is very similar Some in the industry say Apples legal offensive is bad for consumers Thx Apple its now mandatory for tech companies to sue each other Prices go up competition  innovation suffer Mark Cuban an Internet entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team said in a Twitter message But the legal battles are far from over In a separate but related case Apple has won a pretrial injunction against the Google Nexus tablet Another lawsuit against Motorola was thrown out recently by a federal judge in Chicago but litigation between the two at the International Trade Commission continues Earlier on Friday a South Korean court found that both companies shared blame for patent infringement ordering Samsung to stop selling 10 products including its Galaxy S II phone and banning Apple from selling four different products including its iPhone 4 Still the trial on Apples home turf  the worlds largest and most influential technology market  was considered the most important test of whether Apple would be able to gain substantial patent protection for the iPhone and the iPad FASTPACED HIGHSTRESS TRIAL The legal fight began last year when Apple sued Samsung in multiple countries and Samsung countersued The US jury spent most of August in a packed federal courtroom in San Jose  just miles from Apples headquarters in Cupertino  listening to testimony examining evidence and watching lawyers from both sides joust about patents and damage claims Jurors received over 100 pages of legal instructions from US District Judge Lucy Koh on August 21 prior to hearing the closing arguments from attorneys Lawyers from both tech giants used their 25 hours each of trial time to present internal emails draw testimony from designers and experts and put on product demonstrations and mockups to convince the jury At times their questions drew testimony that offered glimpses behind the corporate facade such as the margins on the iPhone and Samsungs sales figures in the United States From the beginning Apples tactic was to present what it thought was chronological evidence of Samsung copying its phone Juxtaposing pictures of phones from both companies and internal Samsung emails that specifically analyzed the features of the iPhone Apples attorneys accused Samsung of taking shortcuts after realizing it could not keep up Samsungs attorneys on the other hand maintained Apple had no sole right to geometric designs such as rectangles with rounded corners They called Apples damage claim ridiculous and urged the jury to consider that a verdict in favor of Apple could stifle competition and reduce choices for consumers Samsungs trial team appeared to suffer from strategic difficulties throughout the case Judge Koh gave each side 25 hours to present evidence but Samsung had used more time than Apple before Samsung even began calling its own witnesses By the end of the trial Samsung attorneys had to forgo crossexamination of some Apple witnesses due to time constraints During closing arguments Samsung lead attorney Charles Verhoeven played mostly defense spending relatively little time discussing Samsungs patent claims against Apple The jury had not been expected to return a decision so rapidly Even on Friday Samsungs lead lawyer was spotted casually clad in a polo Tshirt and jeans But late Friday afternoon a court officer announced a verdict had been reached After the verdict was read Koh found some inconsistencies in the complex jury form and asked the jury to revisit it ultimately resulting in a reduction of about 2 million in the damages award The jury decided Samsung infringed six out of seven Apple patents in the case and that Apple had not infringed any of Samsungs patents Apples protected technology includes the ability for a mobile device to distinguish one finger on the screen or two the design of screen icons and the front surface of the phone The jury also upheld the validity of Apples patents and said Samsung acted willfully when it violated several of Apples patents That could form a basis for Koh to triple the damages tab owed by Samsung This is a vindication of Apples effort to create significant airspace around their design and thats relevant not just for Samsung but for firms coming over the horizon said Nick Rodelli a lawyer and adviser to institutional investors for CFRA Research in Maryland Apples lawyers said they planned to file for an injunction against Samsung products within seven days Koh set a hearing for September 20 The case in US District Court Northern District of California is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et

615,Apple,8/27/2012,Analysis: How Apple overwhelmed Samsung's patent case tactics,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  In August 2010 just a few months after Samsung Electronics launched its Galaxy smartphone a team of Apple Inc lawyers flew to South Korea   Apples late cofounder Steve Jobs had already told Samsung executives at a meeting earlier that summer that he considered the Galaxy S based on Googles Android operating system an illegal copy of the iPhone But given the extensive business ties between the two companies  Samsung is one of Apples key component suppliers  a negotiated solution seemed most likely The Apple attorneys were blunt Android is designed to lead companies to imitate the iPhone product design and strategy read the second slide in their presentation But the meeting did not go well according to a person familiar with the case Samsung attorneys bristled at being accused of copying and produced a set of their own patents that they said Apple was using without permission The meeting brought to the fore a fundamental disagreement between the two companies and set the stage for a bitter multicountry patent dispute that led to Fridays US jury verdict that Samsung had violated Apples patents The jury awarded Apple 105 billion in damages which could be tripled as the jury found Samsung acted willfully Samsung could now face a costly ban on sales of key smartphone and tablet products Shares in Samsung  the worlds biggest technology firm by revenue  tumbled more than 7 percent on Monday set for its biggest daily percentage drop in nearly four years wiping 12 billion off its market value Samsung says it will seek to overturn the decision and the worldwide patent battles among tech giants are hardly over But for now at least the decision in what was widely seen as a critical case promises to reset the competitive balance in the industry The vast majority of patent disputes settle before trial particularly between competitors In this case though the stakes were just too high  and the two companies ultimately had very different views of the often murky legal issues Samsung believed its wireless communications patents were strong and valuable and would serve as a counterweight to any Apple showing of infringement people close to the case say The South Korean company also didnt believe Apple could or should be allowed to claim patent protection on design elements like the form of a rectangle or the front flat surface embodied on the iPhone Apple for its part considered its feature and design patents to be very high up on the intellectual property food chain  and demonstrating their validity was critical to a much wider war against Android The two companies never came close to settling their differences according to courtroom testimony trial evidence and interviews with several sources close to the case And when it came to the trial Samsungs lawyers miscalculated in arguing that a verdict for Apple would harm competition in the marketplace The jurors led by a foreman who holds his own patent were more persuaded by Apples pleas to protect innovation For them it ultimately wasnt even a close call A spokesman for Samsung in Seoul had no immediate comment CORDIAL BUT ADAMANT Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 revolutionizing the mobile phone market But later that year Google then still an ally of Apples unveiled the Open Handset Alliance with the aim of distributing its Android smartphone software to allcomers Googles open approach quickly caught on among manufacturers looking to compete with Apple The strategy infuriated Jobs and by 2009 relations between the two companies had soured and Googles thenCEO Eric Schmidt left Apples board Jobs biographer famously quotes him as accusing Google of grand theft and vowing to go to thermonuclear war over the issue In January 2010 Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC Corp launched a touch screen Androidbased smartphone that sported features very similar to the iPhone Apple sued in March of that year and the Android smartphone patent wars were on HTC though was a minor player compared with Samsung After the cordial but failed August 2010 meeting attorneys from Apple and Samsung talked in a series of meetings both in South Korea California and elsewhere in the United States Apples attorneys set to work putting a price tag on a royalty demand By October 2010 they had concluded that Samsung should pay 24 per smartphone and 32 per tablet Based on Samsungs own estimation of its profits Apples royalty payments would effectively wipe out more than half of Samsungs margins on any phone priced less than 450 And Apples offer wouldnt have covered the unique user experience patents Apple holds dear We made that clear said Apple licensing chief Boris Teksler By the end of 2010 the meetings stopped as the two sides were too far apart VIEWED AS RIPOFF Apple hoped its relationship with Samsung would make filing an actual lawsuit unnecessary Yet instead of wilting under Apples pressure Samsung instead pressed its own patent claims including a critical one relating to how mobile products send and receive information over wireless networks Samsung eventually would request a 24 percent royalty on those patents or 1440 per device But Samsung had committed to license its wireless patents on fair terms to competitors over the years in exchange for the technology becoming part of the industry standard Courts have generally been reluctant to bar companies from using such standards essential patents and thus they are often less valuable than other types of intellectual property Then in early 2011 Samsung released the Galaxy Tab 101 To Apple it was a clear ripoff of the iPad and showed Samsung had no intention of modifying its products Apple sued Samsung in a San Jose California federal court in April 2011 saying the Korean company slavishly copied its designs Samsung quickly counter sued and the dispute bled into at least 10 courts around the world including Australia and South Korea Over the next year outside law firms hired by both companies racked up thousands of billable hours around the world but no decisive rulings threatened either side Jobs passed away in October 2011 and Cook carried on the litigation filed reluctantly he said Until recently it had mostly been a seesaw battle Apple largely succeeded in thwarting HTC But earlier this year a federal judge in Chicago threw out a case pitting Apple against Googles Motorola Mobility unit saying neither side could prove damages For Apple the California lawsuit against Samsung took on even more urgency as it sought to prove the basic validity of its iPhone and iPad patent claims It scored its first serious victory in the San Jose court when US District Judge Lucy Koh issued two sales bans one against the Galaxy Tab 101 and the other against the Galaxy Nexus phone In her ruling on the tablet Koh said Samsung had the right to compete but does not have right to compete unfairly Yet Koh repeatedly urged the two sides to settle Last month Cook and his Samsung counterpart Choi Geesung participated in one last mediation in an attempt to stave off the impending US trial They couldnt agree Besides the dispute over the standards essential patents Samsung believes it has a stronger patent portfolio than Apple when it comes to nextgeneration technology like 4G OUT OF TIME The trial began on July 30 Apple presented top executives who testified in coherent narratives and revealed damaging internal Samsung documents that showed the company modifying its products to be more like the iPhone Samsungs case was far less slick Koh gave both sides 25 hours of trial time but Samsung lawyers used up too much time in the beginning and couldnt cross examine some Apple witnesses towards the end Samsung employees testified through interpreters or in video depositions that alienated jurors Instead of witnesses they sent you lawyers Apple attorney Harold McElhinny said during his closing argument And while Samsungs own patents were a major part of behindthescenes negotiations at trial its lawyers struggled to present them on an equal footing with Apples intuitively comprehensible design and feature patents Samsung could have opted for a separate trial on its patents but declined Its lawyers may have believed that placing its own allegations in front of the same jury would balance out any toxic impact from breaches of Apple patents It didnt work Samsung violated six of Apples patents the jury said Whether damages will be tripled is a decision for Koh in the coming weeks Samsung asked for up to 399 million on its standards patents It got nothing Samsung has vowed to keep fighting It could get an appeals court to delay any potential sales ban which would give it time to bring new modified products to the market But barring a reversal on appeal Apple now has a clear verdict how it values its intellectual property is

616,Apple,8/27/2012,Analysis: Friend and foe; Samsung Apple won't want to damage parts deal,0, SEOUL  Reuters  While Samsung Electronics is reeling from a patent pounding by its smartphone rival Apple Inc this is unlikely to damage the other part of their relationship  where Samsung is the sole supplier of Appledesigned chips that power the iPhone and iPad   At an emergency meeting in Seoul early on Sunday following the damning US legal defeat the South Korean groups post mortem was led by vice chairman Choi Geesung and the head of the mobile business JK Shin rather than by CEO Kwon Ohhyun whose primary role is in charge of the components business The clear message from Samsung is that a strict internal firewall between its handset business and its components operations remains intact While it plans to appeal the US verdict and a damages bill for 105 billion for copying critical features of Apples popular mobile devices  a sum that could be trebled  Samsung will not want to put at risk its Apple supply contract which is worth billions of dollars As well as being the only supplier of micro processors for the iPhone and iPad Samsung also supplies DRAM and NANDtype memory chips and flat screens used in the popular Apple gadgets Samsung products comprise 26 percent of the component cost of the iPhone Samsungs lead counsel Charles Verhoeven was quoted as saying in the media Samsungs component sales could hit 13 billion next year and bring in 22 billion in operating profit according to a recent estimate by Morgan Stanley Thats nearly 8 percent of estimated group operating profit for next year TOO IMPORTANT Experts and analysts said the symbiotic business relationship between Samsung and Apple is too important for either to put at risk Apple needs Samsung to make the iPhone and iPad Period Samsung is the sole supplier of Apples processing chips and without Samsung they cant make these products said James Song an analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities in Seoul Samsung might be considering lots of options to leverage its components business importance and pressure Apple and Apple could be also well aware of this With that in mind Samsung had sought to resolve the patent dispute with Apple  which Apple first brought up shortly after Samsung launched its first Galaxy model in 2010  through negotiation rather than in the courtroom We initially proposed to negotiate with Apple instead of going to court as they had been one of our most important customers Samsung said in an internal memo sent to employees and released to the media on Monday However Apple pressed on with a lawsuit and we have had little choice but to counter sue While Samsung has been found to have copied innovative features of the iPhone and iPad the Korean groups lawyers have emphasized that its own innovative components and wireless technology patents which the US jury ruled that Apple did not violate made Apples products a reality Apple isnt that stupid to risk its Samsung parts deal Apples agreements with Samsung will ensure that Samsung has no choice but to comply and supply Florian Mueller an intellectual property consultant posted on his blog Also Samsungs other customers would lose faith if it turned out unreliable And since Apple threatened Samsung with litigation two years ago its had plenty of time to identify alternatives SHARP SELLOFF Samsung itself shrugged off market concerns that its component contracts were at risk due to the litigation Samsung shares tumbled more than 7 percent on Monday wiping 12 billion off its market value The supply contract remains a separate issue from the litigation and therell be no change to it going forward said an executive who took part in Sundays meeting which was not attended Jay Y Lee chief operating offer and heir apparent to Samsung Chairman Lee Kunhee according to the executive Kwon was promoted to CEO in June with JK Shin and BK Yoon leading the telecommunications and consumer electronics divisions respectively so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest as Samsung supplies parts to its main rivals such as Apple Nokia HTC Corp and Sony Corp As demand for mobile gadgets has soared Samsung announced just last week a 4 billion investment to boost output at its US chip plant where it makes chips for the iPhone and iPad That comes on top of 2 billion of spending Samsung unveiled two months ago to build a new chip plant and the conversion of existing chip lines to make logic chips to power mobile gadgets SUPPLY CHAIN Apple has been looking to spread its supply chain to reduce its reliance on Samsung The US firm frequently faces a supply crunch when a new product is launched triggering a consumer stampede that drives demand far in excess of supply and production capability Earlier this year a source told Reuters that Japans Elpida Memory Inc was selling more than half of its mobile DRAM chips to Apple Samsung mainly competes with Toshiba Corp and Korean rival SK Hynix in supplying memory chips for Apple and LG Display in flatscreen panels Samsung has around 70 percent global market share in mobile DRAMs but Apple sources only 40 percent of its mobile DRAM chip requirement from Samsung a boon to the likes of Elpida and SK Hynix analysts say Shares in LG Display which is widely speculated to supply a new and thinner panel for the next iPhone jumped more than 4 percent on Monday SK Hynix slipped 05 percent in a flat market For its part Samsung is also diversifying its customer base to reduce its reliance to Apple  adding new ones like Qualcomm and thatll prove to be a good strategy longer term as Apple component margins are generally low due to its huge bargaining power said Daewoos Song Other suppliers may benefit from a worsening AppleSamsung relationship in the short term but in terms of margins Im doubtful they can make good money from any Apple cookie crumbs that Samsung throws away Reporting by Miyoung Kim Editing by  Ian Geoghegan

company seeks to safeguard its edge over rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Google Inc   The iPhone 5 fulfilled many of the expectations laid out by gadget geeks and technology analysts ahead of its Wednesday unveiling but offered few surprises to give Apple shares  already near record highs  another major kick There is not a wow factor because everything you saw today is evolutionary I do think they did enough to satisfy said Michael Yoshikami chief executive of wealth management company Destination Wealth Management Other industry analysts speculated about what else was in Apples product pipeline ahead of the crucial yearend holiday season especially since the company stayed mum about an oftrumored TV device or a smaller iPad The consumer electronics giant that in 2010 popularized tablet computing with the iPad has given no hints on whether it plans a smaller version to match cheaper tablets from the likes of Google or Amazoncom Inc We would really like to see the

625,Apple,9/14/2012,Apple's iPhone 5 puts Europe in 4G slow lane,1, LONDONPARIS  Reuters  Apples iPhone 5 launched to great fanfare in the United States on Wednesday will not work on superfast mobile broadband networks in much of Europe potentially confusing consumers and setting back the development of 4G services in the region   The problem lies in the range of spectrum  the airwaves used to carry mobile signals  used in Europe The iPhone 5 is not compatible with 4G services on the 800MHz and 26GHz bands deployed across much of western Europe including Spain Italy and France Instead it works on the 18GHz band which is still being used for voice calls by most operators in Europe Apple will produce three models of the iPhone one optimized for US carrier ATTs network and spectrum bands another for Sprint and Verizons US norms and a third for the rest of the world including two European operators Only Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Everything Everywhere in the UK will initially be able to offer the fastest internet access to iPhone 5 users in their markets because they are the carriers holding the right frequencies Apple could later introduce other models compatible with more European operators needs analysts say but for now some European operators will be hamstrung Vodafone and Telefonicas 02 look to be at a disadvantage in the UK and Germany two of Europes biggest mobile markets because the iPhone wont run on their 4G gear Telecoms executives in Europe had a big dream that the iPhone would be the accelerator to kickstart 4G demand in their markets Informa analyst Thomas Wehmeier said That dream has now gone up in smoke because Apple has made the US and Asia norms the priority and shortchanged Europe Europes construction of 4G networks is lagging behind the US and Asia though European operators are expected to spend 1525 billion over the next three years to upgrade infrastructure to 4G speeds according to Rethink Technology Research The region has only a few hundred thousand 4G subscribers most of whom use laptop dongles or home routers because there are few compatible smartphones available That is starting to change as Samsung Nokia and HTC bring out 4Gcompatible smartphones that work on European norms The lack of a compatible iPhone however is sure to disappoint some operators hoping to benefit from the positive marketing buzz around Apples latest device It remains to be seen how much a lack of 4G speeds will hamper sales of the iPhone 5 in Europe Apple doesnt break down regional revenue but market research group Canalys says that 22 percent of iPhones sold in the second quarter were in Europe Consumers dont necessarily understand the thorny details of mobile broadband speeds and operators dont make things simpler with advertising that often refers to soupedup 3G technologies  which boost speeds via a software upgrade  as offering 4G speeds A survey from consultancy Analysys Mason showed that 46 percent of iPhone 4 users believe that they already have 4G capability even though they dont Analyst Matthew Howett at the consultancy Ovum said that 4G capability was the iPhone 5s biggest selling point Outside the hardcore loyal Apple fans who will buy it anyway the next biggest attraction of the device is its 4G capability he said For those markets where it can be used on a 4G network I think its going to do particularly well and obviously one of those is the UK So for Everything Everywhere this is set to be a real winner Even without 4G the new iPhone will support the faster version of 3G known as DCHSDPA with up to 42 megabit speeds  faster than many home Internet connections Longterm evolution LTE technology as the true 4G gear is dubbed can offer up to 100 megabit speeds O2 Chief Executive Ronan Dunne said the iPhone 5 would remain popular on its network in Britain despite the lack of 4G The new device will work brilliantly on our network he said in an interview Hutchisons 3 brand Britains smallest operator is in line to buy surplus spectrum from Everything Everywhere in the iPhonecompatible band so it may eventually offer a faster service A spokesman for France Telecom also talked up the better speeds that customers of its Orange mobile brand would receive on the new iPhone in France and Spain despite not having 4G However operators have to be careful about how they advertise fast mobile broadband speeds on the iPhone to avoid breaking Apples strict rules on marketing Ovum analyst Howett said Apple was fined roughly 23 million by an Australian court in June for misleading advertising of the iPad which it said was 4Gcompatible when it was not The iPhone 5 will go on sale in the United States Britain France Germany Australia Canada Hong Kong Japan and Singapore on September 21 with preorders a week earlier A further 22 countries including 21 in Europe will launch on September 28 Additional reporting by  Tarmo Virki  in Helsinki and  Sinead Carew

earlier this month when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6 the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform Users complained that the new Maps service  based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NVs data  contained geographical errors and gaps in information and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular from public transit directions to traffic data and streetview pictures We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website adding that the company fell short of its commitment to deliver the best experience possible to our customers Unusually he suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apples App Store while the company improves the product While were improving Maps you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing MapQuest and Waze or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app he said in the letter Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from cofounder Steve Jobs just before his death It also took the additional step of prominently displaying the rival services on its Apps Store It is a bit unusual but at the same time Tim is keeping Apples commitment to provide the best user experience for customers Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said A key reason for Apples success is keeping customers happy so we think this is a good move People forget that Google Maps started out inferior to Mapquest and Yahoo Maps he added Apples homegrown Maps feature  stitched together by acquiring mapping companies and data from many providers including Waze Intermap DigitalGlobe and Urban Mapping  was introduced with much fanfare in June by software chief Scott Forstall It was billed as one of the key highlights of the updated iOS6 software But errors and omissions in the maps service quickly emerged after the software was rolled out ranging from misplaced buildings and mislabelled cities to duplicated geographical features NEW APPLE The last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010 when users complained of signal reception issues on the thennew iPhone 4 model A defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4s design was flawed but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare 90minute press conference called to address those complaints While Apple fixed the issue Jobs had apologized to users only after he was specifically asked if he was sorry He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers naming rivals Research in Motion Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp Cook himself played a key role in convincing Jobs to tackle the negative publicity that arose around that issue something he was initially reluctant to do according to his biographer Finally Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his lethargy Walter Isaacson said in his biography on the late Silicon Valley icon He quoted someone as saying that Apple was becoming the new Microsoft complacent and arrogant The next day Jobs changed his attitude It remains to be seen how fast Apple can fix the mapping glitches Jobs had been in a similar position when he allowed email synchronization software MobileMe to launch in 2008 to deadly reviews The mercurial CEO took the group to task for it and replaced the groups head The service is now folded into the iCloud product Mapping is a complex process that takes a lot of resources and years to perfect said Marcus Thielking cofounder of Skobbler maker of the popular GPS Navigation 2 app built using the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap platform It helps a lot if you have great data to start with he said adding that it appears that different database were thrown together in building Apple Maps They Apple can offer incremental updates and thats what they will do Cook said that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps the better it will get He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps Apple launched the Googlepowered Maps initially with the first version of iOS and created a homegrown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features Cook said As time progressed we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turnbyturn directions voice integration Flyover and vectorbased maps he said in the letter Google provides turnbyturn navigation on Androidbased devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices Apple Maps replaced Google Maps in iOS 6 and the Google service is now only available through a browser Shares of Apple fell 2 percent to close at 66710 on Nasdaq Editing by  Edwin Chan  and

645,Apple,10/12/2012,Apple to host October 23 event iPad mini expected,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc will host an event on October 23 where it is expected to unveil a smaller iPad that will take on the less expensive devices offered by Amazoncom Inc and Google Inc a source familiar with the matter said on Friday   Wall Street analysts have predicted for months that Apple was planning a smaller less costly version of its popular iPad to take on cheaper competing devices a move that analysts say might hurt its margins but prevent its rivals from dominating an increasingly important computing segment The source did not specify what the product would be and an Apple spokesman declined to comment but tech blog AllThingsD reported earlier on Friday that Apple would launch the mini iPad at the event The device is expected by many experts to have a screen between 7 and 8 inches A smaller iPad will directly compete with ecommerce company Amazons Kindle Fire HD tablet and Googles Nexus 7 Both devices have 7inch screens and sell for 199 The first Kindle Fire launched last year grabbed about a fifth of the US tablet market The consumer device company is gearing up to unveil a new product at a major October 23 event said the source who declined to be named only days before Microsoft Corp unveils Windows 8 and its new Surface tablet on October 26 The Nexus 7 manufactured by Asustek Computer Inc has also seen a successful start with the tablet selling out soon after launch One Wall Street analyst said he had seen the smaller tablet dubbed iPad mini by the media while visiting component suppliers in Asia We actually had the opportunity to play with a pilot iPad Mini used by one of the vendors Topeka Capital analyst Brian White said This 785inch iPad Mini fit our hands like a glove and we were easily able to tuck the device in our sport coat offering consumers a more mobile iPad experience for certain use cases Apple events are typically among the mostwatched items on the industry calendar monitored by consumers and technology investors alike The event in two weeks however comes at a time of volatility for the popular technology stock Apple shares closed up 025 percent at 629714 on the Nasdaq market barely recouping significant losses suffered over the past three weeks as investors cashed out after it touched an alltime high of 70507 on September 21 While the stock is up 55 percent this year it is currently down 10 percent from its record high Wall Street analysts have cited concerns about disruptions of iPhone supplies after a riot in September at one of the plants operated by its main contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology and sharp criticism from consumers about errors in its Maps service MARGIN RISK Apples fiscal fourth quarter financial results are scheduled to be released on October 25 two days after the event offering analysts a rare opportunity to grill executives about a new product just after details are made public A smaller iPad could be a risk to Apples industryleading margins given that neither Amazon nor Google has been known to make much money from the smaller tablets Amazons first Kindle Fire just about breaks even according to IHS iSupply estimates But the internet retailer sells a lot of content  music books  through the Kindle line Google has said that its 199 Nexus 7 is being sold at cost and has no profit margin Apple earned gross margins of 23 percent to 32 percent on its US iPad sales between October 2010 and the end of March 2012 a court filing by Apple in a recent patent trial against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd revealed in July The companys margins on US iPhone sales are almost double those of the iPad averaging between 49 percent and 58 percent Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said that if Apple prices the smaller tablet between 299 to 349 it could maintain the current margins The biggest cost in a tablet is the display he said On a mini the display will be a bit cheaper If the tablet is priced below 299 Apple could still maintain a decent margin if it offers 8 GB of storage instead of the minimum 16 GB storage it has in the current iPad Wu added A mini version of the iPad marks a departure for the company that now has just one 97inch iPad although it does come with various storage options and starts at 499 Late Apple founder Steve Jobs famously derided the 7inch screen as unwieldy for tablet applications saying the devices should come with sandpaper so that users can file down their fingers to use them But an internal email revealed during the patent trial showed that Internet chief Eddy Cue argued there was a market for a 7inch tablet and that Apple should have one The email sent in early 2011 to top Apple executives said Jobs had warmed up to the idea

647,Apple,10/23/2012,Apple unwraps mini-iPad to take on Amazon Google,0, SAN JOSE  Reuters  Apple Inc will begin to sell an 8inch version of the iPad on Friday to compete with Amazoncom Incs Kindle and other smaller tablets but it set a higherthanexpected price tag of 329 that Wall Street fears could curb demand   The 79 inch iPad mini marks the iPhonemakers first foray into the smallertablet segment Apple hopes to beat back incursions onto its home turf of consumer electronics hardware while safeguarding its lead in a larger tablet space  one that even deeppocketed rivals like Samsung Electronics have found tough to penetrate Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and marketing chief Phil Schiller took the wraps off the new tablet which essentially has most of the functions and features of the fullsize iPad but in a smaller package Priced at 329 for a wifi only model the iPad mini is a little costlier than some predicted but some analysts see that as a bid to retain premium pricing levels Others fear the gadget will lure buyers away from Apples 499 flagship 10inch iPad while proving ineffective in combating the threat of Amazons 199 Kindle Fire and Googles Nexus 7 both of which are sold at or near cost Apple has always been a premium hardware manufacturer Its basically a hardware company and they dont have Google advertising or Amazons online store to fall back on said Destination Wealth Management CEO Michael Yoshikami But people are happy to pay a premium because its quality hardware and the ecosystem of content and apps cannot be underestimated JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna said however Its coming in the range that most were grumbling about and that quite frankly were a little bit concerned about Its a little confusing at this juncture to try and figure out how it fits into the lineup Is it going to cannibalize the more expensive iPad he said It is worth noting that there are zeromargin products out there competing with them now  and that is presenting some challenges to Apple Frank Gillett an analyst with Forrester who attended the event said he was impressed with the lightness of the iPad mini which he got a chance to play with following the event Apple went for the high end of what people have been thinking of Gillett said adding that Amazon and Google may have to adjust their product lineups to compete with the iPad mini The focus on growing competition was evident as Schiller  at the iPad minis launch event held in San Joses California Theatre  compared the iPad mini with Googles popular 7inch Nexus 7 tablet citing feature by feature why the new Apple device was superior It is unusual for Apple to single out a specific competitor in its product launches Theirs is made of plastic Schiller said referring to the Android tablet The entire Android product is thicker and heavier Schiller later defended Apples pricing of the iPad mini telling reporters he expects consumers to recognize quality and be willing to pay for it FASTER AND SLIMMER In a surprise move Apple also announced a fourthgeneration fullsized iPad just six months after unveiling a third generation device to much fanfare The latest tablet which again sells for 499 is faster and slimmer and comes just days before Microsoft is due to show off its own Surface tablet Apple also unveiled thinner MacBook Pro laptops including a 13inch Retina display SIGHTS ON AMAZON The iPad was launched in 2010 by late Apple visionary Steve Jobs and since then it has taken a big chunk out of PC sales upending the industry and reinventing mobile computing with its appsbased model often called an ecosystem A smaller tablet is the first device to be added to Apples compact portfolio under Cook who took over from Jobs just before his death a year ago Its very cool Cook said of the iPad mini We told you earlier this year you would see some incredible innovation from Apple across the year We think we kept our promise In a rarity for a company that tightly controls events Apple livestreamed its invitationonly presentation to Apple devices such as the iPad and Macintosh computers The Kindle and Nexus 7 have grabbed a chunk of the lower end of the tablet market and proved demand for a pocketsized slate exists Those companies tablets  the most successful other than Apples  have forced Apple into a space it has avoided and at times derided analysts say Amazons 7inch Kindle Fire released last year for 199 was one of the hottestselling holiday gadgets It pressured Amazons margins but potentially garnered millions of new highspending customers for the online retailer Amazon sold more than a million Kindles a week during December paving the way for Google to try out a similarly sized small tablet Amazon has now launched its secondgeneration Kindle Fire HD which it says is the bestselling product across all of Amazon worldwide based on undisclosed US sales figures and international preorders Googles Nexus 7 tablet built by Asian manufacturer Asustek won top marks from reviewers and quickly ran out of stock after its July launch All three companies will be vying to get their devices on shopping lists during the US holiday season which traditionally starts next month Surveys conducted ahead of Tuesdays news suggested some consumers had hoped for a more affordable Apple mini tablet The starting sweet spot for the tablet would be in the 249299 range according to a survey of more than a thousand consumers by Baird Equity Research PRICE IS KEY Jobs famously derided the 7inch screen saying such a device should come with sandpaper so users can file down their fingers But an internal email revealed during a patent trial showed he turned more favorable to the idea by early 2011 Apple has sold 100 million iPads so far with the device accounting for 26 percent of Apples fiscal thirdquarter revenue But analysts are concerned now about erosion of Apples industry leading margins as it takes on the Kindle Fire It earned gross margins of 23 percent to 32 percent on US iPad sales between October 2010 and the end of March 2012 according to a July court filing by Apple Amazons first Kindle Fire just about breaks even after manufacturing costs according to IHS iSuppli estimates and Google has said its Nexus 7 is being sold at cost The pricing may limit sales From a profitability perspective though I think at 330 Apple is still getting adequate gross margins on the sales said Morningstar analyst Brian Colello But at that price point it may limit adoption and unit volumes Apples shares ended regular trading

651,Apple,10/24/2012,Apple's Mac flies in under the radar,0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Amid the fanfare accompanying the noisy launch of the iPad mini this week Apple Inc also took the wraps off new Mac computers   The facelift may help revitalize an important lineup that  while seeing growth tail off in the early part of 2012  yields 14 percent of revenue and still racks up sales growth numbers that are the envy of a flagging PC world On Tuesday Apple took the lid off a slimmeddown iMac and a 13inch laptop with a vastly improved screen setting the stage for a potential revival in sales even as HewlettPackard and Dell Inc struggle just to stay level Earlier this year Apple had also launched an updated MacBook Air  a product analysts say spawned over 20 touchenabled designs from rivals called Ultrabooks which run Microsoft Corps upcoming Windows 8 software Apple remains No 3 in US market share behind HP and Dell But the Macs premium pricing at 1000 and above and its subsequent outsized margins mean a spike in revenue growth can give its bottom line a significant boost The pricing and feature set of the refreshed iMac present an attractive combination and I would not be surprised to see the new iMac stimulate desktop sales in the December quarter and beyond Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes said The decadesold Macintosh line that helped set a stumbling computer company back on its feet  today overshadowed in both revenue and media appeal by the popular iPhone and iPad  saw growth drop to singledigit percentages in the first two quarters of 2012 for the first time since 2009 Yet sales outgrew the PC market overall by more than seven times over the 12 months to June according to CEO Tim Cook and has outpaced PC growth over the last six years Apple reports fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday The company will likely have sold 51 million Macs in the October quarter up just 5 percent Piper Jaffray  Co analyst Gene Munster estimates HALO EFFECT On Tuesday Apple Marketing Chief Phil Schiller called the Mac what began it all and he claimed the Mac was Americas No 1 laptop and desktop among individual models Research houses Gartner and IDC figures place Apple third in the United States with a market share of about 13 percent Regardless where it places at prices starting at 1000 for its MacBook Air and going all the way close to 4000 and growth  while well off the 30percent range of 2010  still defying the market the Mac has proven a consistent moneyspinner for the company even during troubled times for the traditional PC Intel Corp HP and other stalwarts of the PC industry are now fighting to sustain growth as tablet computers eat into their PCrelated businesses While the Mac line has not completely sidestepped PC market trends it has held up better partly because it is targeted at a higherspending clientele that values its consistency visavis the often fragmented PC where multiple vendors supply different components that dont always work seamlessly But it also owes its success in large part to a socalled halo effect stemming from consumers experiences with the iPhone and iPad said Loren Loverde analyst with research firm IDC They are on the positive end of halo effect both in terms of traffic and brand image Loverde said adding that Apple also has yet to fully realize the international growth opportunities for Mac and expects the new products to see good demand during the holiday quarter Late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh in 1984 and it became the first successful computer to feature a mouse and a graphical user interface  a model that has stayed intact through the succeeding decades The desktop Mac itself stuck to that interface but has radically shifted in design over the years to todays slim allinone form Analysts say the redesigned Macs may give Apples December quarter an extra lift but the quarter will hinge mostly on how many consumers bought iPads and iPhones which combined accounts for 72 percent of the companys revenue Cook and other executives are likely to be questioned on the smartphones supply issues and the rampup of the new iPad mini available in stores on November 2 The bigger question is likely the companys ability to ramp supply to meet the strong demand Baird Equity Research analyst William Power said Recent investor concerns regarding Apple have included perceived slowing iPhone innovation the lack of a strong developing market strategy for iPhone and current iPhone supply constraints Apples stock has reflected some of those concerns While the stock is up 52 percent this year it is down 12 percent from its record high of 705 on September 21 Despite the pullback Apple is trading at 116 times next years estimated earnings same as the SP 500 and far

658,Apple,11/2/2012,Apple iPad mini draws New Yorkers; crowds thin elsewhere,0, NEW YORKSAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Incs iPad mini hit stores around the world on Friday attracting sparser crowds than previous Apple launches but the kickoff still drew hundreds of New Yorkers only days after one of the biggest storms to hit the United States   A proliferation of rival gadgets aimed at the holidays and cheaper tablets from Google Inc and Amazoncom Inc may have sapped interest in Apples latest bet resulting in shorter lines outside stores from Tokyo and Amsterdam to Sydney and Hong Kong The 79inch iPad mini marks Apples first foray into the smallertablet segment and is the companys first major new device since the death of its cofounder Steve Jobs last year In Manhattan crowds braved crippled public transit and an early morning chill to line up outside Apples Fifth Avenue flagship store just two blocks from where a damaged crane dangled from a highrise building  a stark example of how superstorm Sandy ravaged the city Some turned up on impulse lacking power and heat at home Lisa Sieber 59 from Germany rode a bicycle to the store because she said she was going stir crazy at her 81yearold mothers home in Manhattans Lower East Side Theres not much to do without power and lights she said I didnt think I needed an iPad but once you get your first Mac you slide into the iPhone and the next one and it makes it easy to get more Apple products While the city was still grappling with Sandys unprecedented devastation some New Yorkers were angry that Apple delayed the stores opening until 10 am Usually its 8 am said Vincent Leroy 27 a student from Long Island City in Queens who showed up at the store at 630 am His friends complained loudly in unison when he told them he had found out about the delayed opening On the US West Coast fewer than a hundred people thronged Apples new outlet in Palo Alto California near the companys Cupertino headquarters and staff appeared to outnumber customers Shares of Apple which hit an alltime high in September slid as much as 27 percent on Friday to 58014 their lowest level in more than three months The shares were down 25 percent at 58165 in late afternoon LATEST SALVO The iPad mini marks Apples assault on the smaller 7inchplus tablet segment hoping to beat back major inroads by Googles Nexus 7 and Amazons Kindle Fire this year It is the latest salvo in a global mobiledevice war with software giant Microsoft Corp angling its Windows 8driven Surface tablet for the holidays Unveiled last week the iPad mini has won mostly positive reviews but criticism centered on a heftier price tag and a screen considered inferior to those of rival gadgets like the Nexus 7 It replicates most of the features of its fullsized sibling Apple will likely sell between 1 million and 15 million iPad minis in the first weekend  far short of the 3 million thirdgeneration iPads that sold last March in their first weekend according to Piper Jaffrays Gene Munster While launch lines and initial weekend sales may not be as impressive as previous iPad launches the iPad mini will be a hit product for Apple and become a more significant part of the story over the next two to three quarters Munster said The iPad mini is the first device to be added to Apples compact portfolio under Chief Executive Tim Cook who took over from Jobs months before his death a year ago Analysts credit Google and Amazon for influencing the decision Some investors worry that Apple might have lost its chief visionary with Jobs or that new management may struggle to stay ahead of the pack as rivals innovate and encroach on its turf Jobs launched the original iPad in 2010 which has since taken a big chunk out of PC sales On Friday Apple also began selling the fourth generation of that 97inch device much the same as before but with a faster A6X processor and better WiFi Both devices hit stores across 34 countries on Friday HONG KONG AMSTERDAM When Apples flagship Hong Kong store opened on Friday staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line In Amsterdam two hours after the store opened it looked like a typical day with no lines outside An Apple employee told Reuters that people had lined up ahead of the store opening There were queues of 100 or more outside Apple stores in Tokyo and Seoul when the device went on sale But fewer people turned up in Sydney than for previous iPhone launches Its so thin and light and very cute  so cute said Ten Ebihara at the Apple store in Tokyos upscale Ginza district Reviewers have applauded Apple for squeezing most of the iPads features into a smaller package that can be comfortably manipulated with one hand But at 329 for a WiFionly model the iPad mini is a little costlier than predicted though some analysts see that as Apples attempt to retain premium positioning Some investors fear the gadget will lure buyers away from Apples 499 flagship iPad while proving ineffective in

uncertain about its ability to fend off unprecedented competition and untangle a snarled iPhone 5 supply chain   Apples slide outpaced the SP 500s drop of about 24 percent the day after the US election putting the worlds most valuable technology company into bearish territory Long a mainstay of many fund portfolios Apple on Wednesday lost 20 percent  130 billion of its market value  since hitting a record high in September A 20 percent slump signals a bear market for a stock to Wall Street Fund managers cited fundamental concerns about iPhone 5 supply and intensifying competition from resurgent rivals such as Samsung Electronics and Amazoncom Inc as well as profittaking after the elections Global shares fell with investors worried that the deep fiscal challenge facing President Barack Obama after his reelection could lead to a new recession Apples share price drop since September comes on the heels of torrid growth since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010 which upended the PC industry and carved out a new device segment But many investors question whether it can keep innovating and keep ahead of evermore aggressive competition under new CEO Tim

we needed Its to be determined if they can continue to do that said David Readerman portfolio manager at Forward Management which has 55 billion under management We started to trim our position in the

662,Apple,11/16/2012,High-flying Apple falls to earth as investors fret over taxes,1, NEW YORK  Reuters  Gravity has taken hold of Apple and a lot of investors have been smacked on the head   Apple Inc the largest US stock by market value was headed toward its eighth straight week of declines on Friday as the rush to secure profits before a potential hike in capital gains taxes next year has investors dumping the market favorite Since hitting a record high of 70507 a share in September Apple has lost about a quarter of its value The stocks descent has vastly outpaced those of the SP 500 which is down just under 7 percent in the same time frame No individual investment can defy gravity said Erik Davidson deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank in San Francisco The declines have shaved about 170 billion off the companys market capitalization  or just a bit more than the entire value of CocaCola Apple is still currently worth about 493 billion about 100 billion more than the secondmost valuable US company Exxon Mobil Apple on Friday afternoon was little changed up 02 percent at 52659 Taxes on capital gains and dividends are likely to rise next year as part of an expected deficitcutting deal to avoid the socalled fiscal cliff of scheduled tax hikes and spending cuts With a stock like Apple where investors may have large embedded capital gains as a result of its stellar run selling now locks in gains and offsets the possibility of higher taxes next year The uncertainty over the outcome of talks in Washington over the fiscal cliff has sapped the natural inclination to buy declining shares Some of the selling is being driven by these tax decisions but the flip side is there is not a lot of buyers because the buyers are procrastinating to see how the negotiations come out said Bucky Hellwig senior vice president at BBT Wealth Management in Birmingham Alabama You probably have an inordinate effect to the downside because of these tax strategies The current 15 percent tax rate on dividends and capital gains is scheduled at expire at year end and the two items are to revert back to being taxed as ordinary income which means the highest earners would face rates of 35 percent The recent plunge is a reversal of fortune for highflying Apple those though the shares remain up about 30 percent for the year so far Apple shares have rise every year since 2003 with the exception of 2008 when the market was struck by the global financial crisis If youve got all these gains  which a lot of Apple investors have because its done very very well  then youre going to see selling in the likes of Apple and other companies that have had good runs Davidson said Apples stock has been below both its 14day and 50day moving average for over a month suggesting both the short and midterm momentum is negative Despite the declines Thomson Reuters StarMine estimates the stocks intrinsic value is about 83390 a share That figure is derived from analyst estimates for growth over the next five years and StarMines expected growth rates for several years after that Given that the stock is likely worth more than where it is trading tax concerns are probably playing into the recent weakness said Phil Orlando chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York I think the stock is worth 750 said Orlando If you are sitting here looking at Apple trading at 500 you say Well the stock ought to be 50 percent higher over the course of the next year or two so the stock looks pretty attractive Reporting by Leah Schnurr and Chuck Mikolajczak Editing by Leslie Adler,75.028572,86.554283

664,Apple,12/5/2012,Apple's shares swallow biggest loss in four years,0, NEW YORKSAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc shares tumbled more than 6 percent on Wednesday chalking up their biggest singleday loss in four years as fears grow about intensifying competition in the mobile device market   The selloff fueled by a forecast by an influential research firm that the iPad maker is continuing to cede ground to rival Google Inc Android gadgets rounded off a bleak 10 weeks for the most valuable US company The stock was one of Wednesdays biggest percentage losers on the SP 500 shedding 35 billion of market value as more than 37 million shares changed hands  blowing past the companys average daily volume over 50 days of 21 million Apples shares once among the most desirable of portfolio holdings have headed steadily south since September on growing uncertainty about the companys ability to fend off unprecedented competition This year saw a surge in sales of Amazoncom Incs cheaper Kindle Fire and Microsoft Corps first foray into the tablet market with its Surface Meanwhile Samsung Electronics continues to chip away at the iPads dominance with its Galaxy line The assault on Apples consumerelectronics home turf presents a stiff challenge for CEO Tim Cook who was elevated shortly before the death of Silicon Valley legend Steve Jobs and is now charged with keeping the worlds largest technology company humming This is not going to be a shortterm trend This is a management test of how well they can perform without Steve Jobs said Brian Battle director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago Referring to Apples new iPad mini which is only a smaller version of the existing iPad Battle said the company needs another home run for shares to return to levels around 700 They need another new product that hits it out of the park Without that they could get a gradual grinddown in confidence he said On Wednesday research firm International Data Corp said Apple most likely shed market share in the tablet computer space in 2012 Its worldwide tablet market share will slip to 538 percent in 2012 from 563 percent in 2011 while Android products would increase their share to 427 percent from 398 percent IDC said Concerns that tax rates on dividends and capital gains may rise next year were also cited as contributing to the Apple selloff The stocks massive market value meant Apple was almost singlehandedly responsible for Wednesdays 11 percent decline in the Nasdaq 100 Index Apple is still up 33 percent this year but is down nearly 24 percent from its record high of 70507 hit on September 21 The stock slid more than 64 percent on Wednesday to close at 5387923 BEFUDDLING SLIDE Some analysts were perplexed at the fall from favor in Apple stock which has been a staple in almost all growth portfolios The company is expected to deliver reliably high revenue and earnings expansion for years to come and one in two tablets sold globally remains an iPad It is now gearing up for the introduction of its latest iPhone 5 and iPad mini in international markets It will begin selling the iPhone 5 in 50 countries in December including China and South Korea Apple stock is significantly more volatile than its earnings and innovation stream said Daniel Ernst analyst with Hudson Square Research And yet the wind blows slightly from the south instead of the east one particular morning and the stock is down 6 percent It makes no sense There are lines around the block for their products all around the world he added No other company has that Separately Nokia on Wednesday said it will partner with China Mobile the worlds biggest mobile operator in a sales deal that will give the Finnish company an opportunity to win back Chinese market share from Apples iPhone While lines for the latest iPads appeared lighter than usual when it hit stores in November Apple said at the time that demand was so strong that it practically sold out of iPad minis It sold 3 million of the new iPads  including the fullsized version  in the first three days on the market Some analysts suggested that investors also sold shares of Apple amid uncertainty over ongoing fiscal negotiations in Washington If no agreement is reached on the issue higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains are possible in 2013 Investors who had hoped for a special dividend this year as many other corporations have announced on expectations of higher tax rates next year may be disappointed as time is running out If you were expecting a special dividend by year end thats less likely to happen because its December 5 said Colin Gillis an analyst with BGC Partners The fear of higher taxes on capital gains also has prompted some investors to lock in profits now particularly on a stock like Apple which has posted gains of at least 25 percent for four consecutive years Depending on what happens with the US fiscal negotiations rates could rise next year or they could stay the same said Battle of Performance Trust Capital They will not be lower so if youre an investor who has seen gains in Apple it is better to take those gains this year rather than next Tax selling can take a life of its own said Tim Ghriskey chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills New York Some taxable investors take the gains that creates some negative momentum institutional investors are heavily weighted the stock and reduce exposure Some market participants also cited reports by media including CNBC which Reuters could not confirm that margin requirements on the trading of Apple stock had been raised by at least one clearing firm Additional reporting by Charles Mikolajczak in New York and  Doris Frankel  in Chicago Editing by  Bernadette Baum  Andrew

667,Apple,12/7/2012,China's mini Apple takes slice of smartphone pie,0, BEIJING  Reuters  Chinas Xiaomi Technology is a fairy tale for nerdy entrepreneurs   Less than three years after its founding the smartphone maker is valued at 4 billion and evokes Applelike adoration from its fans some of whom are desperate enough to skip work for a shot at buying the latest product the day it goes on sale Founder Lei Jun dresses like the late Steve Jobs in jeans and a black top He has created a fervent fan base for Xiaomis moderately priced highend smartphones by mimicking Apple Incs marketing tactic of attaching an aura of exclusivity around its products Before Xiaomi the 42yearold Lei was a key investor in Chinas early Internet scene cofounding startups including Joyocn which was eventually sold to Amazoncom Inc and the recently listed YY Inc Born in Xiantao a small city in Chinas central Hubei province better known for breeding Olympic gymnasts than billionaire technocrats Lei brushes off comparisons to Jobs but concedes that the Apple visionary was an inspiration Chinas media say I am Chinas Steve Jobs Lei told Reuters in an interview I will take this as a compliment but such kind of comparison brings us huge pressure said Lei who grew up assembling radios as a hobby Xiaomi and Apple are two totally different companies Xiaomis based on the Internet We are not doing the same thing as Apple HOT SALES AND FANS Xiaomi has already sold 300000 of its latest phone model launched in October The Xiaomi phone 2 has specifications similar to those of Samsung Electronics Galaxy S3 and Apples iPhone5 but a topoftheline model sells for about 370 half the price of an iPhone5 Unlike the big domestic smartphone players such as Lenovo Group ZTE Corp and Huawei Technologies which work with telecom carriers to sell a large volume of smartphones Xiaomi sells most of its phones online and in small batches This small volume strategy creates pentup demand that gives Xiaomi free marketing buzz The first batch of 50000 phones released on October 30 sold out in less than two minutes Subsequent larger batches have also sold out in minutes Lei who has nearly 4 million followers on Chinas popular microblogging platform Weibo feeds the buzz by dangling teasers about new products and launch dates Were not a company that chases sales volume We chase customer satisfaction We look for ways to give the customer a great surprise Lei said His vision for an exclusive midtier brand that builds up incrementally rather than swamping the market has found financial backers In June Xiaomi raised 216 million from Singapores sovereign wealth fund the Government of Singapore Investment Corp and a few of Leis friends local media reported giving it a valuation of 4 billion China is ripe for its own Apple HTC or Samsung said Hans Tung managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners a venture firm backing Xiaomi The country is big enough there are enough mobile Internet users and mobile phone consumers Therefore having its own mobile ecosystem built up by a domestic brand makes sense Xiaomi which was founded in April 2010 and only started selling smartphones in October 2011 is on track to sell 7 million units this year exceeding its target of 2 million Xiaomi is already profitable and is expected to rake in sales of up to 13 billion yuan 2 billion this year Our product only sold for a year and hit sales of 2 billion That is pretty impressive Lei said adding Xiaomi was not considering an initial public offering within the next five years Tung said Xiaomis net margins were 10 percent This suggests its net profit could hit 200 million this year Mo Xiaohua a 24yearold accountant is a proud Xiaomi fan who only recently bought her first Xiaomi phone For many who use Xiaomi phones the customizable themes and the weekly updates are a big draw I like Xiaomi because among Chinas brand smartphones its value is the best Mo said Now that we have such a good China branded phone we need to support it BLACK BACK FLATS Xiaomi has its fair share of detractors who doubt it will have a happy ending They say the smartphone game in China can only be won with wide distribution and high volume or a big brand with distinctive designs Xiaomi whose attraction is its price and high technical specifications does not win points for cuttingedge design This is a world where people are now cranking out black back flats thats what all these phones are when you put 10 on the table Xiaomi is not going to stick out said Michael Clendenin managing director at RedTech Advisors In this world the market is driven by two things one is massive volume and two huge brands ZTE and Huawei have set smartphone sales targets for this year at about 30 million and 60 million respectively The firms have traditionally dominated the cheap lowend smartphone segment but have been pushing into the midprice range ZTE said it launched 11 types of smartphones in the midprice range of 15002500 yuan this year up from six last year Apple released its midrange tablet the iPad Mini in China on Friday Xiaomi had great headline appeal a year ago but the problem is now you have got guys like ZTE and Huawei and Meizu with phones that are priced in a similar range Clendenin said China is expected to surpass the United States as the worlds largest smartphone market this year with 165170 million unit sales up from 78 million last year Gartner said Analysts said Xiaomi had to ramp up volume and address technical problems and a shortage of customer service centers if it wanted a shot at the big league One of the challenges of being in the middle is that you can get squeezed said Duncan Clark chairman of Beijingbased consultancy BDA Lei is resolute that he will prove the naysayers wrong In this industry I think the most important thing is to get love from your customers he said If you are popular with your customers you succeed 1  62253 yuan Additional reporting by Jane Lee and the

668,Apple,12/13/2012,iPhone 5 hits China as Apple market share slips,0, SHANGHAI  Reuters  The China release of its iPhone 5 on Friday should win Apple Inc some respite from a recent slide in its share of what is likely already the worlds biggest smartphone market but its longerterm hopes may depend on new technology being tested by Chinas top telecoms carrier   Cupertino Californiabased Apple has been in talks about a tieup with China Mobile for four years A deal with Chinas biggest carrier is seen as crucial to improve Apples distribution in a market of 290 million users  which is forecast to double this year China is Apples secondlargest and fastestgrowing market  it brings in around 15 percent of total revenue  but the companys failure to strike a deal with China Mobile means it is missing out on a large number of phone users As the China pie grows Apples sales increase but without China Mobile its losing ground at a faster rate compared to other brands In absolute terms this iPhone 5 launch will certainly result in strong sales for Apple in China However in relative terms I dont believe it will move the needle enough in market share said Shiv Putcha a Mumbaibased analyst at Ovum a global technology consultant China Mobile and Apple initially said they were separated only by a technical issue  as the Chinese carrier runs a different 3G network from most of the world  but that has evolved into a broader and more complex issue of revenuesharing China Mobile and Apple still have to solve many issues such as the business model articles of cooperation and revenue division but I believe we will reach an agreement eventually China Mobile CEO Li Yue was reported by Chinese media as saying in Guangzhou last week Apple China declined to comment China Mobile said it had no update to the Apple discussions STRONG PREORDERS Apples ranking in Chinas smartphone market slipped to sixth in JulySeptember according to research firm IDC IDnL4N09G1QK but investors primed to look to China product launches for an uptick in Apples quarterly sales have good headline numbers to digest  more than 300000 iPhones preordered on one carrier alone But its the lack of a deal with the No1 carrier that prevents those numbers being stronger The iPhone is currently sold through Apples seven stores resellers and through China Unicom and China Telecom  which together have fewer than half the mobile subscribers of bigger rival China Mobile Apples market share declined because of the transition between the iPhone 4S and 5 Their market share will recover with the iPhone 5 but if you dont have China Mobile the significant market share gains will be very difficult said Huang Leping an analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong TDLTE STILL DISTANT Cutting a deal with a Chinese stateowned carrier may be less optimal than the deals Apple is used to in other markets and analysts note that China Mobile wouldnt necessarily open the flood gates for Apple Ovums Putcha believes Apple and China Mobile will eventually strike a deal  though this would be for an iPhone running on China Mobiles nextgeneration network rather than its current 3G network Of China Mobiles 704 million

and even there rivals are rolling out models with China Mobile Last week Nokia said it planned to release its latest Lumia smartphone with Chinas top carrier which is also expected to launch Research in Motions new Blackberry 10 analysts predict The threat will still come more from the Android camp where they have many vendors already working with China Mobile and offering highend phones said TZ Wong a Singaporebased IDC analyst While these smartphones dont generate the buzz of a new iPhone Chinese buyers are not known for their brand loyalty and this could siphon away users considering an Apple upgrade Ive used a Blackberry Android and iOS and personally I want to try the Windows 8 said Andy Huang a 37yearold fund manager who owns most iPad models an iPhone 4 and a 4S I think the Windows 8 is very innovative With a China Mobile deal looking some way off Apple could always boost market share by offering cheaper models  the basic iPhone 5 will cost 5288 yuan 850 without a contract  though this appears an unlikely route for a highend brand If they want to expand market share probably the only way to do it here dramatically would be to put out a lower cost phone said

682,Apple,1/7/2013,Analysis: Apple bid for Samsung sales ban faces skeptical court,1, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc faces long odds in its attempt to overturn a US appeals court ruling that threatens to undermine its smartphone patent war against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   Apple has asked the full Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to revisit an October decision by a threejudge panel of the court which rejected its request to impose a sales ban on Samsungs Galaxy Nexus smartphone ahead of a trial set for March 2014 In that ruling the Washington DCbased appeals court raised the bar for potentially market crippling injunctions on product sales based on narrow patents for phone features The legal precedent puts Samsung in a much stronger position by allowing its products to remain on store shelves while it fights a global patent battle against Apple over smartphone technology Apple hopes the full Federal Circuit made up of nine active judges will reverse the panels findings But legal experts say the specific legal issues involved are not likely to be controversial enough to spur full court review Furthermore the three judges who issued the ruling were unanimous whereas the Federal Circuit tends to review a case en banc  with all of the active judges  when an earlier ruling showed a split The Federal Circuit fight comes after Apple won a 105 billion verdict last year against Samsung in a California federal court The same trial judge will preside over the legal battle surrounding the Nexus phone which involves a patent not included in the earlier trial The fight has been widely viewed as a proxy war between Apple and Google Inc Samsungs hotselling Galaxy smartphones and tablets run on Googles Android operating system which Apples late cofounder Steve Jobs once denounced as a stolen product Google has not had much luck in obtaining injunctions against Apple either In a deal with federal antitrust regulators announced last week the Android developer agreed to limit when it can use certain swaths of its patent portfolio to seek injunctions Samsungs legal papers arguing against full court review of the Federal Circuit ruling on Galaxy Nexus sales are due this week To win a rehearing before the full court Apple needs five out of the nine judges to vote in favor Representatives for Apple and Samsung both declined to comment RAISING THE BAR In the October ruling the threejudge panel found that Apple did not have enough evidence of a causal nexus between its patented search capability and iPhone sales to prove that Samsung has caused harm justifying an injunction US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose California who has presided over much of the AppleSamsung litigation in the United States cited the panels decision in a December order rejecting Apples request for permanent sales bans on several Samsung phones Apple has said it would appeal Kohs ruling A wide sales ban against Samsung products could be devastating Apple claims that 227 million of Samsungs total unit sales from mid2010 to March 2012  or 816 billion in US revenue  came from products that infringed Apple patents It will be hard to convince the Federal Circuit to revisit the injunction issue because the legal arguments involved are not among those that have caused the most recent controversy at the court said R Polk Wagner a professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School and a former Federal Circuit clerk For example no outside groups have filed briefs supporting Apples bid for en banc review according to court records In contrast the court last year granted en banc review in a case about the scope of software patents currently a hot topic in intellectual property debates A threejudge panel in that case split 21 and outside advocacy groups filed briefs urging full court review Oral arguments are set for February The Federal Circuit is eight times more likely to grant an en banc petition if a third party files a brief urging it to do so according to a 2010 study by Colleen Chien a professor at Santa Clara Law in Silicon Valley The study covered 20 years of Federal Circuit activity While tough for Apple persuading the court to grant en banc review is not impossible court watchers say Some of the Federal Circuit judges including Chief Judge Randall Rader  who was not part of the panel that issued the October ruling  are considered by legal experts to be proplaintiff believing that injunctions are a crucial tool for enforcing patent rights If Apple loses at the Federal Circuit the company could ask the US Supreme Court to take up the matter However the Supreme Court has made it more difficult for patent plaintiffs to secure sales injunctions in recent years suggesting it would be unlikely to review this case

696,Apple,1/30/2013,Analysis: The funds that saw Apple's decline coming,0, NEW YORK  Reuters  The slump in Apple Incs share price from its September high has badly dented the returns of hundreds of mutual funds that had maintained outsized holdings of the stock But some went sour on the iPhonemaker just in time   Of the 321 funds that had more than 5 percent of their assets in Apple shares at the beginning of 2012 53 of them  or slightly more than 16 percent  significantly cut back their weighting of the company before the plunge gained momentum according to data from Morningstar Whether it was a case of simple risk management concerns that the companys share price had peaked or a bit of luck fund managers who drained Apple from their portfolios helped drive down the price of the stock As a result of their early shift in sentiment they appear quite prescient now Denverbased fund manager Tom Marsico sold his firms entire stake in the company between November and January  most of it in November before things got really ugly At about 2 billion of the firms 31 billion in assets under management the Apple stake made up between 6 to 8 percent of the domestic portfolios at the time he began selling His concern that the company had saturated the market with its products so much that there was no one left to sell to Frank Caruso portfolio manager of the 17 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth fund began underweighting the stock in the spring believing Apple was losing the pricing premium for its products George Sertl a portfolio manager of the 891 million Artisan Value Fund sold as Apple raced through his price targets using some proceeds to buy Samsung instead The result Investors in these funds largely sidestepped the implosion of one of the most widelyheld US stocks Apples share price ended Tuesday at 45827 down 35 percent since hitting a record high of 70507 on September 21 brought down by concerns ranging from its lack of cool new products to increased competition from other mobile phone manufacturers After the company missed Wall Streets quarterly revenue estimates on Jan 23 the shares dipped 12 percent the next day The drops in the companys share price were painful for big individual shareholders The value of Apple chairman Arthur Levinsons 239541 shares fell by 591 million between late September and January 28 while board member and former US VicePresident Al Gores stake fell by 25 million CEO Tim Cooks paper wealth of 1 million restricted shares which will fully vest in 2021 fell approximately 247 million The declines hit ordinary fund investors as well At an average of 76 percent of fund assets Apple was by far the most heavilyheld stock among large cap growth funds as of the end of November according to data from Lipper a Thomson Reuters company The next mostheld company Google Inc made up an average of 32 percent of assets at the end of November That concentration on one stock  albeit one with a history of doubledigit annual gains  made many mutual funds riskier for investors exposing their savings to the ups and downs of one company  And while Apple currently makes up about 58 percent of the Russell 1000 Growth index the main benchmark that growth funds are compared to many fund managers took on much larger stakes The 304 billion T Rowe Price Growth Stock fund for example increased its stake in Apple to 122 percent of its assets as of November 30 from 91 percent at the end of 2011 according to Morningstar One of the mostwidely held funds in 401k accounts it has underperformed the broad market since the beginning of the year gaining 42 percent while the SP saw a 58 percent return That was lackluster enough to put it in the 85th percentile in its category according to Morningstar data The top funds in the category returned between 7 and 8 percent T Rowe declined comment The 108 billion JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Select fund meanwhile increased its stake in Apple to 87 percent of assets from 66 percent of assets between December 31 2011 and the end of November buying approximately 904000 shares in the first 11 months of 2012 The fund has underperformed the SP 500 by 11 percentage points since the start of the year according to Morningstar BRUISED APPLE Marsico the Denverbased manager began selling his position in the company when it traded at around 650 per share out of concern that its years of phenomenal growth were over We didnt see another major category that would provide the opportunity that the iPhone has had for the company he said The companys strong lineup of current products didnt entice him to stay invested Theyve talked about the fact that they have the best products theyve ever had But I remember you could say the same thing about Sony 20 years ago he said Marsico has used the Apple proceeds to increase or initiate positions in pharmaceutical stocks Among his new favorites are BristolMyers Squibb Co whose bloodthinner Eliquis received US Food and Drug Administration approval in late December and BioGen Idec which is expected to introduce a new treatment for multiple sclerosis in the second quarter He is also adding to his position in Google based on the theory that the companys development of YouTube will attract advertising dollars Shares of Google are up 116 percent over the past 3 months Some managers trimmed their overweight positions but were held back from selling more because of the companys massive pile of cash Daniel Rosenblatt a portfolio manager of the 639 million Neuberger Berman Large Cap Disciplined Growth fund began trimming his position in Apple by approximately 10 percent from 81 percent of assets to 72 percent of assets as the company approached its high The company which had been among the funds largest positions since 2004 was clearly in a deceleration mode Rosenblatt said He was most troubled by surveys that showed that even diehard Apple fans were more open to using rivals products When a product loses a certain amount of cool its pricing power falls he said Yet he wont short the stock or sell more because the companys large cash position which makes up about a third of its market value could change the dynamics of the stock price overnight via a big buyback or acquisition he said Hes buying companies like semiconductor manufacturer ASML Holding Intel Corp invested 4 billion in the Dutch company in July and Samsung invested nearly 1 billion in August to help its research into ultraviolet technology that they believe could lead to much cheaper gadgets Artisans George Sertl trimmed his Apple stake as the stock rose above the high 500s He used part of the proceeds to increase his position in Apple rival Samsung But recently hes been buying Apple for less than he sold it He believes Apple and Samsung now among his fivelargest holdings are the best positioned to benefit from mobile and tablet growth and they spend enough on development and marketing to fend off rivals Apple has one of the best brands and balance sheets in the world he said The market is discounting a lot of problems Reporting By David Randall Editing by  Martin Howell  and  Claudia

700,Apple,2/7/2013,"Einhorn says Apple has ""Depression mentality"": CNBC",1, Reuters  Apple Inc is hoarding cash because of a Depressionera mentality and needs to unlock more value for shareholders Greenlight Capitals David Einhorn told CNBC on Thursday   Einhorn said Apple should issue preferred shares with a 4 percent yield adding that if Apple issued 500 billion in such stock it could unlock 320 per share in value Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz  Editing by Gerald E McCormick,66.178574,96.525711
701,Apple,2/7/2013,Einhorn sues Apple marks biggest investor challenge in years,1, NEW YORKSAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc on Thursday confronted its first major challenge from an activist shareholder in years as hedge fund manager David Einhorns Greenlight Capital filed suit against the company and demanded that it dole out a bigger piece of its 137 billion cash pile to investors   The unusual move comes as the worlds largest technology company grapples with a tumbling share price mounting competition in the smartphone and tablet markets and concerns about its ability to produce new breakthrough products Einhorn a wellknown shortseller said in an interview with CNBC that Apple had a Depressionera mentality that led it to hoard cash and invest only in the safest lowestyielding securities Apple nearly went broke in the 1990s before Steve Jobs returned and engineered a sensational turnaround with products such as the iPhone and iPad that became musthaves for consumers around the world The companys neardeath experience has led Apple to be exceptionally conservative with its cash Last March just months after Jobs death Apple responded to a barrage of investor criticism over its large cash hoard by initiating a quarterly cash dividend and a share buyback that would pay out 45 billion over three years At the time Apple was sitting on 98 billion in cash Einhorns lawsuit targets a proposal by Apple to eliminate preferred stock from its charter He urged Apple shareholders to vote against the plan at the companys annual meeting on February 27 and put forward a proposal of his own for the company to issue preferred stock with a perpetual 4 percent dividend Apple shares which had fallen 35 percent from the record high hit in midSeptember through Wednesday ended 3 percent higher at 46822 Einhorn often cited as one of the most committed Apple bulls remains long on its shares But the fund manager whose Greenlight had a subpar year in large part because of Apples late2012 stock swoon said the company needs to fix its cash problem It has sort of a mentality of a depression In other words people who have gone through traumas  and Apple has gone through a couple of traumas in its history they sometimes feel like they can never have enough cash Einhorn said on CNBC Investors who have long railed against what they saw as Apples ultraconservative attitude toward its cash rallied around Einhorn in principle In an interview with Reuters Einhorn said he had gone to Apple CEO Tim Cook in recent weeks after the companys chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer brushed off his entreaties in September Cook who is rarely known to engage investors in exclusive conversations was unaware of the earlier conversations with Oppenheimer according to Einhorn When I discussed this with Tim Cook and actually the conversation has been going on for the last couple of weeks he said that he wasnt familiar with my previous conversations with Peter Oppenheimer and whoever Peter Oppenheimers advisers were I was surprised by that Einhorn told Reuters But Apple fired back on Thursday afternoon saying Einhorns lawsuit over the shareholder proposal was misguided Contrary to Greenlights statements adoption of Proposal 2 would not prevent the issuance of preferred stock it said in a statement Currently Apples articles of incorporation provide for the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval If Proposal 2 is adopted our shareholders would have the right to approve the issuance of preferred stock SHARES UTTERLY MISVALUED Einhorns actions go well beyond increasingly common shareholder calls for Apple to increase its dividend or buy back shares Einhorn argues preferred stock  which functions like a bond in that it pays a fixed dividend over time  is a better route because the company wont have to use cash right away Analysts say another benefit is up to 80 percent of the dividends from preferred stock can be taxfree for corporate investors and it is not logged as debt on the balance sheet But the tactic is generally pursued by lowgrowth companies where capital gains are less assured The idea is powerful and when I have a chance to explain it to the shareholders most will see it as an enormous winwin Einhorn told Reuters Calling Apple shares utterly misvalued at current levels in the CNBC interview Einhorn said the company no longer needs to grow at the neartripledigit rates of the past For every 50 billion in preferred stock that Apple gives away to shareholders it could unlock 32 a share in value for investors Einhorn said without explaining his rationale We understand that many of our fellow shareholders share our frustration with Apples capital allocation policies Greenlight said in an open letter to investors Apple has 145 per share of cash on its balance sheet As a shareholder this is your money Einhorn said he suggested to Apple an initial preferred share distribution in which dividends could be funded on an ongoing basis by a relatively small percentage of the companys operating cash flow Apple rejected the idea outright in September 2012 he said and then refused to withdraw the proposal to eliminate preferred stock from its charter Some investors saw merit in Einhorns argument Its a great company but their greatest weakness is capital allocation said Mark Mulholland portfolio manager of the 417 million Matthew 25 fund which has some 17 percent of his portfolio in Apple DIMINISHING CLOUT Analysts have expected stockholder pressure to increase as Apples share price declines and its outlook grows murkier The California company had 1371 billion in cash shortterm and longterm marketable securities such as US Treasuries at the end of 2012 with over 94 billion of that overseas This is something that we continuously assess the opportunities to both invest in the business and return cash Apples Oppenheimer said on the companys postresults conference call last month We do consider increasing these programs and well do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders It remains to be seen whether other major Apple investors will get behind Einhorns initiative Mulholland called the preferred stock idea interesting and unique He also said he supported Einhorns opposition to the shareholder proposal and would vote against it saying Theres no reason to put something like that in On the flip side the California Public Employees Retirement System which owns 27 million Apple shares urged investors earlier this week to vote in favor of the shareholder proposal and opposes blank check preferred shares Money managers have complained that Apple stockpiles excessive cash and does a poor job putting it to work The weightedaverage interest rate earned on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities came to just 107 percent in its 2013 fiscal first quarter and 102 percent in the 2012 fiscal year Some questioned whether taking the company to court was the right way to induce action If you own the company you should let management have some say in how they run it Im not a fan of using the legal system to address what should be a corporate issue said John Manley chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage funds Jeffrey Manns an associate professor of law at George Washington University said Einhorn does have legal standing to bring his case even though it has little precedent Greenlights lawsuit takes aim at what it calls the bundling of several proposals into a single vote Greenlight wants the proposals separated so a vote can be taken specifically on Apples move to strike preferred shares from its company charter Greenlight alleges that Apple is not complying with US Securities and Exchange Commission rules requiring separate votes for distinct and unrelated amendments to the charter This procedural legal strategy is merely a vehicle to raise his profile and promote his agenda about shaping Apples corporate strategy Manns said of Einhorn HISTORY OF ACTIVISM Einhorn has a history of activism usually directed at struggling companies or those grappling with management issues In 2011 he urged Microsoft Corp to get rid of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer accusing him of being stuck in the past Einhorn slashed his stake in the software giant six months later Einhorn has enjoyed something of a cult following in the 2 trillion hedge fund industry ever since his bearish call on Lehman Brothers in early 2008 But 2012 was not his best year Thanks to losses on Apple and in the gold market Greenlight Capital posted a modest 83 percent gain for the year after losing 28 percent in December a person familiar with the funds performance said That lagged the SP 500 indexs 134 percent gain excluding dividends You could see Einhorn stirring up other activist investors to twist them I would certainly applaud their efforts said Tim Lesko portfolio manager at Granite Investment

703,Apple,2/8/2013,Einhorn case against Apple rests on unusual legal tactic,1, NEW YORK  Reuters  Hedge fund star David Einhorn wants to force Apple Inc to share some of its huge cash reserves with investors but his lawsuit rests on a US securities rule that has little legal precedent   Einhorns Greenlight Capital sued the iPad and iPhone maker in US District Court in Manhattan on Thursday to try to prevent Apple from eliminating preferred stock from its charter The suit is part of Einhorns bid to pressure Apple to use some of its 137 billion in cash to issue perpetual preferred shares that pay dividends to existing shareholders The suit contends Apple violated Securities and Exchange Commission rules that prohibit companies from bundling unrelated matters into a single proposal for a shareholder vote Establishing that Apple violated the rules could be tricky Little to no case law exists on the question and the SECs own rule is relatively general with little guidance legal experts said Still James Cox a professor at Duke University School of Law thinks Einhorn has a hell of good case I think hes got Apple in the crosshairs he added saying that it strikes me as a fairly dramatic case of bundling The hedge fund manager is seeking an injunction to block a February 27 shareholder vote on the proposal saying Apple violated Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Arguments are to be heard before US District Judge Richard Sullivan on February 22 Apple has until February 15 to file a response with the court The proxy proposal at issue Proposal No 2 seeks to amend Apples articles of incorporation in three ways by providing for majority voting for directors establishing a par value for Apple stock and eliminating its ability to issue preferred stock Einhorn is represented by law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer  Feld Greenlights longtime outside counsel No lawyer for Apple is yet listed on the court docket and a representative declined to say who would represent Apple in the case On Friday the California Public Employees Retirement System the biggest US public pension fund and owner of 27 million Apple shares and influential proxy voting firm ISS Proxy Advisory Services both urged investors to vote in favor of the shareholder proposal in question All shareholders should have a vote Anne Simpson CalPERS Senior Portfolio Manager and Director for Corporate Governance said on CNBC We dont want the board cutting a deal on the side with a hedge fund out of fear of a lawsuit that will cancel the annual meeting This is a big issue that needs to be thought through carefully and we want the board to come to all shareholders and give a chance to have their voice heard ISS which issues recommendations on how shareholders should vote on proxy proposals generally believes the bundling of proposals was not in the best interest of shareholders but supported the elimination of blank check preferred shares due to their potential to be misused as a takeover defense Though many investors have viewed Apples cash holdings as excessive and wanted to see more of it returned to shareholders that view may not be universally held other investors may prefer to see the cash or at least a large portion of it deployed for investments and acquisitions it said in its Friday statement HOW WILL APPLE RESPOND It is unclear how Apple will respond in its formal reply to the lawsuits On Thursday Apple said Einhorns lawsuit was misguided and that adoption of Proposal No 2 would not preclude preferred share issuances in future Currently Apples articles of incorporation provide for the issuance of blank check preferred stock by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval Apple said If Proposal 2 is adopted our shareholders would have the right to approve the issuance of preferred stock Einhorn a wellknown shortseller and Apple gadget fan said in an interview with CNBC the company harbored a Depressionera mentality that led it to hoard cash and invest only in the safest lowestyielding securities Apple nearly went broke in the 1990s before Steve Jobs returned and engineered a sensational turnaround with products such as the iPhone and iPad that became musthaves for consumers around the world The companys neardeath experience has led Apple to be exceptionally conservative with its cash Greenlight in its complaint said it supports two of the proposals but not getting rid of preferred stock Einhorn deems preferred stock superior to dividends or share buybacks and has separately put forward a proposal for an issuance of Apple preferred stock with a perpetual 4 percent dividend But as Apples proxy proposal is structured Greenlight said shareholders have no choice but to either vote in favor of an amendment they oppose or against an amendment they support Few lawsuits have ever been filed challenging proposals under the rules a situation some legal experts attributed to the normally passive nature of shareholders In most cases youre not going to get a lot of complaining about bundling said Brian Slipakoff special counsel at law firm Duane Morris in Philadelphia In one of the few related lawsuits the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York in 1999 recognized an implied private right of action by shareholders suing over alleged antibundling rule violations That precedent could back Einhorn in his legal standing to bring the case The appeals court ruling was cited by Greenlight in additional court papers filed late on Thursday Francis Vasquez a lawyer with the law firm White  Case who is not involved in the case said Apple might argue that because the stockholder proposals in Proposal 2 are all amendments to the charter they are properly related The California company has another five proposals up for a vote which are not being challenged by Einhorn and do not involve amending Apples charter Those measures focus on matters such as director elections and executive compensation Apples first argument likely is going to be Look these are all amendments we put in one place they dont have to do with the other items Vasquez said The antibundling rules date from 1992 John Coffee a professor at Columbia Law School said the idea was to prevent managements from bribing shareholders with a sweetener into voting for a proposal they would otherwise reject The case is Greenlight

706,Apple,2/12/2013,"Apple CEO calls Einhorn lawsuit a ""silly sideshow""",0, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said the board is carefully considering David Einhorns proposal for the company to issue preferred stock and return more cash to investors but he called a lawsuit brought by the star hedge fund manager against Apple a silly sideshow   Waving aside Einhorns assertion that Apple is clinging to a Depressionera mentality Cook said on Tuesday the companys board is in very active discussions on how to dole out more of its 137 billion hoard of cash and marketable securities Einhorn and his Greenlight Capital are suing Apple as part of a wider effort to get the iPhone maker to share more of its cash pile one of the largest among technology companies They are challenging Proposal 2 in Apples proxy statement which would abolish a system for issuing preferred stock at its discretion Einhorn wants Apple to issue perpetual preferred shares that pay dividends to existing shareholders which he argued would be superior to dividends or buybacks Cook gave Einhorn credit for a novel idea but the usually unflappable chief executive turned slightly impatient when discussing the lawsuit He was also dismissive of Einhorns media and legal blitz  which included the lawsuit as well as multiple television and media interviews Einhorn seeks an injunction to block a February 27 shareholders vote on Proposal 2 in what amounts to the biggest challenge to Apple from an activist investor in years This is a waste of shareholder money and a distraction and not a seminal issue for Apple That said I support Prop 2 I am personally going to vote for it Cook told a packed hall at Goldman Sachs annual technology industry conference in San Francisco The conflict over Prop 2 is a silly sideshow added Cook who on Tuesday traded in his usual casual jeans attire for slacks and a dark suit jacket in a nod to Wall Street Cook said he thought it bizarre that we would find ourselves being sued for doing something good for shareholders Einhorns clash with Apple centers on a proposed change to its charter that would eliminate the companys ability to issue blank check preferred stock at its discretion Apple which said the change would not preclude future issuance of preferred shares is recommending shareholders vote in favor at its annual meeting on February 27 The lawsuit filed in the US district court in Manhattan objects to the bundling of the charter change with two other corporate governancerelated proposals in Proposal 2 The hedge fund manager a wellknown shortseller and Apple gadget fan counters that striking the preferredshare mechanism from the charter would make it more difficult to issue such securities down the road If Apple thinks the lawsuit is a waste of resources it could simply end the matter by complying with existing law and filing a new proxy that unbundles the proposed changes to the charter so that shareholders can express their views on each matter separately a Greenlight Capital spokesman said in an emailed statement responding to Cooks comments On Tuesday influential advisory firm Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote in favor of Proposal 2 joining ISS and the California Public Employees Retirement System  the top US pension fund  in voicing support for the measure Apple and Greenlight appear for oral arguments in US district court in Manhattan on February 19 DIMINISHING CLOUT Investors however were disappointed that Cook  who rarely makes lengthy publicspeaking engagements  did not provide a more substantial view on returning cash Apples share price has tumbled in recent months from a high of just over 700 last September They finished 25 percent lower at 46790 on Tuesday The only thing that would substantially move the stock would be him saying they were returning cash to shareholders or hinting at a new product said a manager from a midsize Dallas hedge fund that owns Apple shares There was a small chance of that happening Apple stock is a mainstay of many fund managers portfolios with research firm eVestment estimating that 75 percent of US largecap growth managers had invested more than 5 percent of their portfolios in Apple as of the end of the third quarter of 2012 But that also increases the pressure on Apple to give away a bigger portion of its cash hoard which is rising as the share price declines and its outlook grows murkier Last March Apple announced a quarterly cash dividend and a share buyback that would pay out 45 billion over three years At the time it was sitting on 98 billion in cash It has so far returned 10 billion of that but investors want more Apples own view is that its cash pile is a strategic cushion offering it more flexibility if a need ever arises such as a major acquisition Cook said the company had pondered more than one large acquisition in the past but none passed its internal test The company could well do one in the future if the technology fits he said We have the management talent and depth to do it he said We dont feel the pressure to go out and acquire revenue FREEWHEELING DISCUSSION Cook introduced by Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein at the outset offered other views on topics from screen sizes and the future of the personal computer to Apples commitment to great products He disputed a popular view that the smartphone market in developed markets may be saturated On a longerterm basis all phones will be smartphones and theres a lot more people in the world than 14 billion and people love to upgrade their phones very regularly he said The company is also trying to appeal to costconscious customers Apple has moved to make the iPhone more affordable without introducing a specific cheaper phone by cutting prices of older models We didnt have enough supply of iPhone 4 after we cut the price he said It surprised us the level of demand for it The chief executive who departed for Washington DC after the conference to join US first lady Michelle Obama at the Presidents State of the Union address later on Tuesday otherwise stuck pretty much to his regular script  with a sprinkling of lighter more personal moments He grew animated when praising Apple employees or talking about the companys efforts to improve labor conditions across its sprawling supply chain and touted the Apple store concept for its uplifting ability Cook said that when he is down he just visits an Apple retail store Its like Prozac Its a feeling like no other Additional reporting by

708,Apple,2/13/2013,High stakes if Apple e-books antitrust case goes to trial,0, NEW YORK  Reuters  As the only remaining defendant in the US governments ebooks antitrust case Apple Inc appears headed for a highstakes trial that could significantly increase the personal computer companys liability in related litigation   Apple faces a June 3 trial date over civil allegations by the US Department of Justice that it conspired with five publishers to raise the price of ebooks and to fight the dominance of Amazoncom Inc On Friday Macmillan became the fifth and final publisher to settle with the government The Justice Department alleges that Apple came to agreements with each of the publishers meant to ensure that ebook prices at its iBookstore and other retailers would remain higher than those offered by Amazoncom At the Apple trial to be overseen by US District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan the Justice Department will seek not monetary damages but a judicial decree that Apple violated antitrust law court papers said Among other things government lawyers want the judge to issue an order enjoining Apple from engaging in any conduct similar to that alleged in the case Such a judgment could make Apple vulnerable to steep damages in related litigation Apple and the publishers also face a classaction suit filed on behalf of consumers and a similar suit filed by dozens of state attorneys general Neither suit puts a figure on the exact amount of damages sought The Consumer Federation of America estimated in a letter last year to the Senate antitrust subcommittee that ebook price fixing would likely cost consumers more than 200 million in 2012 State and federal antitrust laws allow plaintiffs to recover triple the amount of actual damages established at trial If Apple loses against the Justice Department those plaintiffs would be in a powerful position to win their cases according to Harry First a professor at New York University School of Law specializing in antitrust Under the Clayton Act an antitrust statute plaintiffs can use judgments obtained by the US government as evidence against defendants If Apple loses it is unclear whether both the states and the private plaintiffs will be able to seek and recover damages for the same conduct By contrast if Apple were to prevail it would cause a lot more trouble for the plaintiffs in the other cases First said Apple declined to comment It still may settle with the US government In December Apple and four publishers came to an agreement with European Union regulators over their antitrust probe into ebooks The fifth publisher Pearson Plcs Penguin group also under investigation was not part of the European deal announced in December LITTLE TO GAIN Apple may have little to gain by going to trial in the United States according to some legal experts Under settlements with the Justice Department the five publishers were required to terminate or not renew deals with Apple and other retailers that the government claimed were anticompetitive Apple and the government have less to argue over since those deals have been undone Daniel Crane a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School said What are they fighting over he said Crane added that Apple may be interested in going to trial to establish an antitrust principle that might help other aspects of its business such as content deals with entertainment companies The trial would be a big test for the Justice Departments Antitrust Division which has sought to enhance its reputation for its trial capabilities under the Obama administration The government has been represented by Mark Ryan who is director of litigation a new position in the Antitrust Division Ryan who began in January 2012 was hired by Joseph Wayland the

715,Apple,2/19/2013,Exclusive: Apple Macs hit by hackers who targeted Facebook,0, BOSTONSAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Apple Inc was recently attacked by hackers who infected Macintosh computers of some employees the company said Tuesday in an unprecedented disclosure describing the widest known cyber attacks targeting Apple computers used by corporations   Unknown hackers infected the computers of some Apple workers when they visited a website for software developers that had been infected with malicious software The malware had been designed to attack Mac computers The same software which infected Macs by exploiting a flaw in a version of Oracle Corps Java software used as a plugin on Web browsers was used to launch attacks against Facebook which the social network disclosed on Friday The malware was also employed in attacks against Mac computers used by other companies Apple said without elaborating on the scale of the assault Twitter which disclosed that it had been breached February 1 and that hackers might gave accessed some information on about 250000 users was hit in the same campaign according to a person close to the investigation Another person briefed on the case said that hundreds of companies including defense contractors had been infected with the same malicious software Though this person said that the malware could have originated from China there was no proof This is a new campaign Its not like the other ones you read about where everyone can tell its China the first person said Investigations into the breaches are ongoing It was not immediately clear when the attacks had begun the extent to which the hackers had succeeded in stealing data from targeted systems or whether all infected machines have been identified The malware was distributed at least in part through a site aimed at iPhone developers which might still be infecting visitors who havent disabled Java in their browser the person close to the case said There is a version that infects computers running Microsoft Windows as well Security firm FSecure wrote that the attackers might have been trying to get access to the code for apps on smartphones seeking a way to infect millions of endusers It urged developers to check their source code for unintended changes Apple disclosed the breach as tensions are heating up over US allegations that the Chinese military engages in cyber espionage on US companies US cyber security firm Mandiant reported over the weekend that it has uncovered evidence that the Chinese military is behind a slew of cyber attacks on US businesses The White House said it has repeatedly raised concerns about Chinese cyber theft with Beijing The breaches described by Apple mark the highestprofile cyber attacks to date on businesses running Mac computers Hackers have traditionally focused on attacking machines running the Windows operating system though they have gradually turned their attention to Apple products over the past couple of years as the company gained market share over Microsoft Corp This is the first really big attack on Macs said the source who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly Apple has more on its hands than the attack on itself Charlie Miller a prominent expert on Apple security who is coauthor of the Mac Hackers Handbook said the attacks show that criminal hackers are investing more time studying the Mac OS X operating system so they can attack Apple computers For example he noted hackers recently figured out a fairly sophisticated way to attack Macs by exploiting a flaw in Adobe Systems Incs Flash software The only thing that was making it safe before is that nobody bothered to attack it That goes away if somebody bothers to attack it Miller said NATIONAL SECURITY Cyber security attacks have been on the rise In last weeks State of the Union address US President Barack Obama issued an executive order seeking better protection of the countrys critical infrastructure from cyber attacks White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday that the Obama administration has repeatedly taken up its concerns about Chinese cyber theft with Beijing including the countrys military There was no indication as to whether the group described by Mandiant was involved in the attacks described by Apple and Facebook An Apple spokesman declined to specify how many companies had been breached in the campaign targeting Macs saying he could not elaborate further on the statement it provided Apple has identified malware which infected a limited number of Mac systems through a vulnerability in the Java plugin for browsers The malware was employed in an attack against Apple and other companies and was spread through a website for software developers the statement said We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them from our network There is no evidence that any data left Apple it continued The statement said Apple was working closely with law enforcement to find the culprits but the spokesman would not elaborate The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment Apple said it plans to release a piece of software on Tuesday that customers can use to identify and repair Macs infected with the malware used in the attacks Editing by  Andre Grenon   Edwin Chan  and

716,Apple,2/21/2013,"Einhorn says Apple ""iPref"" stock would unlock value",1, Reuters  Star hedge fund manager David Einhorn has a new product that he wants Apple Inc APPLO to offer the iPref   In an unusual hourlong public conference call on Thursday Einhorn who has filed a lawsuit against Apple as part of an effort to get the iPhone and iPad maker to distribute more of its 137 billion cash pile detailed the merits of distributing perpetual preferred stock to reward investors and boost a share price that he says is undervalued This is not complicated its merely unfamiliar Einhorn said about his perpetual preferred stock idea Heres the product that Apple doesnt yet know it needs he said a riff on the mantra of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs that consumers dont know what they want Einhorns firm Greenlight Capital currently holds 13 million Apple shares now worth nearly 600 million Einhorn said Apple should use 47 billion in cash to issue preferred stock with a quarterly dividend of 50 cents in perpetuity The stock would be in high demand he said because savers across the country are in desperate need of yield It has a base value of 50 and pays a dividend of 2 per year he said Apple can redeem them for face value but shareholders should not anticipate getting the face value They should expect to receive 50 cents per quarter every quarter forever Colin Gillis an analyst at BGC Partners said the conference call by Einhorn who like most hedge fund managers typically makes few disclosures about his investment views beyond required regulatory filings was a plus for him I think it helped his plight Gillis said He laid out a well articulated pitch He broke down various scenarios showed what would happen under different cases or expected outcomes He makes a compelling case As of the end of December Apple had 1371 billion in cash up 68 percent from the end of its 2011 fiscal year on September 24 2011 More than twothirds of that amount is held overseas Einhorn went on his public attack in early February with the suggestion for perpetual preferred stock He then sued the company over the formulation of its proxy statement Einhorn is seeking an injunction to block a February 27 shareholders vote on Proposal 2 in Apples proxy statement which would abolish a system for issuing preferred stock at the companys discretion Apple has since said it will consider the idea for the stock though CEO Tim Cook has dismissed the lawsuit over the proxy statement as a silly sideshow There are very few highquality issuers that approach Apples quality Einhorn said IBMs paper yields the same as Microsofts We think Apples should at least trade as high Einhorn believes iPrefs should trade at an 80basispoint spread to 30year Treasuries Over time the iPrefs should be highly liquid We expect the market to accept the iPrefs as a premium quality instruments Overall iPrefs could yield 4 percent and to receive that from someone who cant fail is quite exciting Einhorn added Einhorn said that once iPrefs are distributed the annual dividend payment on them would be 19 billion Annual earnings per share estimates would then be reduced by 2 offsetting the amount of the dividend For example Apples earnings for the current fiscal year would be 43 per share Einhorn said That would reduce the common stock price to 430 he said But it adds value of 50 for 480 which is 30 higher than the current stock price Einhorn predicts that if iPrefs were distributed at a ratio of five shares for every common stock they would pay out 250 to investors while lowering the stock price from 450 to 350 But when the value of the iPrefs is figured in with the new common stock price the value would be 600 per share Apples shares on Thursday closed down 06 percent at 44606 The shares had traded as low as 44282 before Einhorns call While iPref distribution combined with existing dividend would exceed existing cash flows we think it could fund it through the existing domestic cash balance and future cash flow without ever depleting the cash balance Reporting By Jennifer Ablan in New York and Poornima Gupta in San Francisco Additional reporting by Sam Forgione in New York Editing by Leslie Adler,63.714287,100.300003

719,Apple,2/25/2013,Apple signals emerging-market rethink with India push,0, NEW DELHIBANGALORE  Reuters  As BlackBerry launches the first smartphone from its makeorbreak BB10 line in India one of its most loyal markets the company faces new competition from a formidable rival that has long had a minimal presence in the country   More than four years after it started selling iPhones in India Apple Inc is now aggressively pushing the device through installment payment plans that make it more affordable a new distribution model and heavy marketing blitz Now your dream phone at 5056 rupees 93 read a recent full frontpage ad for an iPhone 5 in the Times of India referring to the initial payment on a phone priced at 840 or almost two months wages for an entrylevel software engineer The newfound interest in India suggests a subtle strategy shift for Apple which has moved tentatively in emerging markets and has allowed rivals such as Samsung and BlackBerry to dominate with more affordable smartphones With the exception of China all of its Apple stores are in advanced economies Apple expanded its India sales effort in the latter half of 2012 by adding two distributors Previously it sold iPhones only through a few carriers and stores it calls premium resellers The result iPhone shipments to India between October and December nearly tripled to 250000 units from 90000 in the previous quarter according to an estimate by Jessica Kwee a Singaporebased analyst at consultancy Canalys At The MobileStore an Indian chain owned by the Essar conglomerate which says it sells 15 percent of the iPhones in the country iPhone sales tripled between December and January thanks to a monthly payment scheme launched last month Most people in India cant afford a dollarpriced phone when the salaries in India are rupee salaries But the desire is the same said Himanshu Chakrawarti its chief executive Apple the distributors retailers and banks share the advertising and interest cost of the marketing push according to Chakrawarti Carriers like Bharti Airtel Ltd which also sell the iPhone 5 run separate ads India is the worlds No 2 cellphone market by users but most Indians cannot afford fancy handsets Smartphones account for just a tenth of total phone sales In India 95 percent of cellphone users have prepaid accounts without a fixed contract Unlike in the United States carriers do not subsidize handsets Within the smartphone segment Apples Indian market share last quarter was just 5 percent according to Canalys meaning its overall penetration is tiny Still industry research firm IDC expects the Indian smartphone market to grow more than five times from about 19 million units last year to 108 million in 2016 which presents a big opportunity Samsung Electronics Co Ltd dominates Indian smartphone sales with a 40 percent share thanks to its wide portfolio of Android devices priced as low as 110 The market has also been flooded by cheaper Android phones from local brands such as Micromax and Lava Most smartphones sold in India are much cheaper than the iPhone said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta Where the masses are  there Apple still has a gap I LOVE INDIA BUT Apple helped create the smartphone industry with the iPhone in 2007 But last year Apple lost its lead globally to Samsung whose smartphones which run on Google Incs free Android software are especially attractive in Asia Many in Silicon Valley and Wall Street believe the surest way to penetrate lowerincome Asian markets would be with a cheaper iPhone as has been widely reported but never confirmed The risk is that a cheap iPhone would cannibalize demand for the premium version and eat into Apples peerless margins The new monthly payment plan in India goes a long way to expanding the potential market said Chakrawarti The Apple campaign is not meant for really the regular topend customer it is meant to upgrade the 1000012000 handset guy to 45000 rupees he said Apples main focus for expansion in Asia has been Greater China including Taiwan and Hong Kong where revenue grew 60 percent last quarter to 73 billion Asked last year why Apple had not been as successful in India Chief Executive Tim Cook said its business in India was growing but the group remained more focused on other markets I love India but I believe that Apple has some higher potential in the intermediate term in some other countries Cook said The multilayer distribution there really adds to the cost of getting products to market he said at the time Apple which has partly addressed that by adding distributors did not respond to an email seeking comment Ingram Micro Inc one of its new distributors also declined comment Executives at Redington India Ltd the other distributor could not immediately be reached BlackBerry which has seen its global market share shrivel to 34 percent from 20 percent over the past three years is making what is seen as a lastditch effort to save itself with the BB10 series The highend BlackBerry Z10 was launched in India on Monday at 43490 rupees 800 close to the 45500 rupees price tag for an iPhone 5 with 16 gigabytes of memory Samsungs Galaxy S3

adding that it will tieup with banks for installment plans Until last year BlackBerry was the No 3 smartphone brand in India with market share of more than 10 percent thanks to a push into the

731,Apple,4/24/2013,Apple's cash plan takes heat off Cook buys him time,1, Reuters  Tim Cook wants investors to think different about Apple less as a hypergrowth startuplike company and more as a mature but robust technology corporation with the worlds biggest dividend   If Wall Street follows Apple Incs famous advertising slogan of old it may relieve some of the pressure on Apples chief executive quiet investors grumbling about its recent share price slide and buy the company time to do what it says it does best come up with and market new products On Tuesday Apple said it would return 100 billion to shareholders by the end of 2015 in part by raising its dividend 15 percent and in part by increasing its share buyback program sixfold to 60 billion To some extent the expanded capital return program helped mask its first quarterly profit decline in a decade though analysts say the more important issue now is what Apple has in store on the gadget front Apple shares were up 02 percent to 40696 in afternoon trading on Wednesday reversing direction after falling about 1 percent in early trading The stock has seen a 43 percent slide since midSeptember With Apple planning to borrow money to reward shareholders  one way to circumvent repatriating its vast overseas cash for that purpose  it could go from having zero debt to a company that rivals major global banks such as Citigroup in issuing bonds The company received an AA rating from Standard  Poors missing the top rating due to earnings growth uncertainty Following the earnings at least 17 brokerages lowered their price targets on the stock including JPMorgan which cut its target by 25 percent Apples earnings growth trajectory has come to earth in the last year After posting average annual earnings per share growth of 62 percent over the past five years its profit is now forecast to grow at just 45 percent a year for the next decade For this year earnings per share are expected to fall 44 percent according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data ADMITTING A CHANGE Cook is trying to reset heightened expectations around a company once universally feted for its ability to captivate both consumers and Wall Street In the years following the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010 the company established a pattern of consistently blowing past even the most bullish Wall Street earnings expectations much to everyones delight But on Tuesday Cook made the rare admission to analysts on a conference call that Apples growth has slowed and margins have decreased Apple is a mature company thats now trying to get everyone to see it as one analysts say They are modulating into a state where the highs are not as high and lows are not so low Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps said Apple shares moved 5 percent higher Tuesday on the back of the capital program though the gains evaporated later Any gains would have come as little consolation to investors who have watched Apple shed more than 280 billion in market value in the last few months as investors adjusted to a new slowergrowth reality Roger Kay president of researcher and consultant Endpoint Technologies Associates said the expanded share repurchase and dividend scheme would keep investors satisfied for a while In the longer term Apple needs another blockbuster gadget to accelerate its momentum and win investors back for the longer term Cook tried on Tuesday to drum up enthusiasm around the product pipeline by teasing that some really great stuff potentially in new product categories was coming in the fall and in 2014 They need something that breaks into new verticals whether its TV or something thats wearable that opens up a new revenue stream Epps said RESETTING THE SCALE That remains among the most pertinent concerns for Applewatchers Since Cook took over in 2011 from late cofounder Steve Jobs some investors have questioned whether Apple can continue to upend technology markets with new revolutionary products that appeal to consumers in the absence of the tech icon Cook has in the past year presided over three straight quarters of missed revenue expectations before the JanuarytoMarch period The key product introduced during his tenure is the smaller iPad mini a response to tablets such as Amazoncom Incs Kindle that were making inroads on its home turf The public takes as a given that a new iPhone and new iPads will come this year along with refreshed Mac computers and iPod music players But the speculation is that Apple is also working on a watch a television and a radio service among other products in the pipeline Cook would not provide any more details on new products no surprise given the companys penchant for secrecy Some investors remain confident the Apple magic remains The bar has been reset in terms of expectations and guidance They have done the right thing by issuing debt and doing a large buyback said Jason Jones who runs tech hedge fund firm HighStep Capital and confessed to being an Apple bull The company will go through this quiet period for product release and then starting in the summer and for the remainder of the year product announcements will pick up and likely the stock will react favorably to that While Apple is still growing  no small achievement for a company with sales well over 100 billion  its pace of growth has slowed as highend smartphone adoption approaches saturation and rivals flood the market with cheaper devices which are popular in highgrowth developing countries like China and India Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that Samsung

741,Apple,5/21/2013,The Irish loophole behind Apple's low tax bill,1, LONDON  Reuters  Apples ability to shelter billions of dollars of income from tax has hinged on an unusual loophole in the Irish tax code that helps the country compete with other countries for investment and jobs   A US Senate investigation has revealed that Apple maker of iPhones iPads and Mac computers had channeled profits into Irishincorporated subsidiaries that had no declared tax residency anywhere in the world Apple revealed on Tuesday that the arrangements dated back over 30 years and had been negotiated with Irelands government which has long angered European peers such as France and Germany by helping multinationals to avoid paying tax on sales its makes to their citizens in their domestic markets Apples annual reports show that over the past three years Apple paid taxes worth 2 percent of its 74 billion in overseas income Apple channels most of its overseas sales through three companies which are incorporated in Ireland but tax resident in no jurisdiction US rules that allow companies incorporated abroad not to pay US taxes complement that arrangement Apple tax head Phillip Bullock told the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday that one of these three subsidiaries Apple Operations International AOI had not submitted a tax return anywhere for five years All three were registered in Ireland in 1980 and reregistered as unlimited companies in 2006 which means under Irish law that they do not have to publish annual accounts so the subcommittees report was the first time the current structure had been publicly revealed Peter Vale tax partner at accountants Grant Thornton in Dublin said it was unusual for companies incorporated in Ireland not to be tax resident there  but it is legal Apple relies for its tax benefits on contrasting approaches to determining tax residence in Ireland and the United States Vale said that if a group has at least one trading Irish subsidiary  as Apple does in the form of units that employ 4000 staff  it can establish a corporation that will not be deemed tax resident in Ireland providing this units central management control is outside the country The subcommittee said AOI and ASI held board meetings in the United States and most board members were based there That means the units would not be deemed to have Irish management control accountants said Apple told the subcommittee that AOIs assets are managed by employees at an Apple subsidiary Braeburn Capital located in Nevada while its assets are held in bank accounts in New York and its primary accounting records are maintained at Apples US shared service centre in Austin Texas Despite this AOI did not have tax residency in the United States because said Lyn Oates professor of tax and accounting at the University of Exeter Business School the United States determines tax residence on the place of incorporation only LOST PROFIT Britain also used to allow companies to be incorporated there without being tax resident but changed its system over 20 years ago to stop tax avoidance said Penelope Tuck Associate Professor of Public Finance and Policy at the University of Warwick Ireland did not change its rules probably because there was not the same concern about the loss of tax revenues said Professor Eamonn Walsh Professor of Accounting at University College Dublins Graduate School of Business Irelands small population of 46 million means multinationals generate relatively little by way of sales or profits there From a policy point of view people are more concerned with the idea that highpaid jobs are being delivered to the local economy Walsh said Apples Chief Executive Tim Cook told a hearing of the subcommittee on Tuesday in Washington that Apple was attracted to Ireland in 1980 at a time when the country offered incentives to technology companies as it tried to build an industrial base Over the years the structures Apple uses have evolved but it appears the support of the Irish government has continued Since the early 1990s the government of Ireland has calculated Apples taxable income in such a way as to produce an effective rate in the low single digits Apple tax chief Bullock told the subcommittee in earlier testimony A Reuters analysis of Apples annual reports shows that it was in the late 1990s that Apples overseas tax rate really began to hit rock bottom after the United States began to let firms avoid US tax on overseas earnings in what became known as the checkthebox CTB loophole From 1993 to 1995 the three years before CTB emerged Apple had an effective overseas tax rate of 16 percent After this the rates plummeted and averaged 2 percent in the past three years One former official with the Irish Development Authority which had the task of enticing foreign companies to invest in Ireland said that after the introduction of CTB in the United States firms began to demand lower tax deals in Ireland While the Senate subcommittee referred to Apple negotiating tax rates of below 2 percent Ireland usually facilitates low tax payments not by undercutting its headline corporate tax rate of 125 percent but by allowing companies to declare low taxable profits  often by making deductions for payments to taxexempt affiliates usually offshore Ireland said the low tax payment was not its fault and blamed other countries tax legislation Apples exact arrangements in Ireland have changed over the years Up until 2004 or later the three Apple companies were assessed for taxation in Ireland although the declared profits were much lower then In 2004 ASI declared a profit of 325 million and paid Irish tax of 21 million its accounts from the time show In 2011 according to the subcommittees report ASI earned 22 billion and paid just 10 million in global taxes Apples retail units in France Germany and Britain purchase goods from the Irish units The prices are set at levels that ensure these units in bigger states do not report much profit This means the company avoids tax on sales in its bigger markets In 2011 the last year for which accounts are available Apple Retail UK Ltd reported profits of 31 million pounds on sales of 860 million pounds and paid tax of 9 million pounds In the same year Apple Retail France reported a loss of 21 million euros on sales of 346 million euros and paid income tax of 7 million euros Apple Retail Germany reported a 4million euro loss on sales of 174 million euros and paid no income tax Other jurisdictions also offer tax advantages like Ireland Online retailer Amazoncom Inc for example pays low taxes on its overseas income by channeling European sales through a Luxembourgbased company that makes untaxed payments worth hundreds of millions of euros each year to a taxexempt partnership also resident in Luxembourg Web search giant Google pays low taxes by channeling overseas sales through an Irish unit that pays most of its income to an affiliate in Bermuda The schemes used by all three companies work by arranging for the units that make sales to customers in Europe and elsewhere to make taxdeductible payments to untaxed or little taxed affiliates for the use of intellectual property such as brands and business processes The Group of 20 leading nations has asked the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development thinktank to look at such corporate profitshifting and one area it is examining closely is such payments for intangible assets The companies say they follow the tax rules in all the countries where they operate Reporting by Tom Bergin Editing by Will Waterman and  Alastair Macdonald ,62.592856999999995,88.11856800000001
742,Apple,5/21/2013,Apple CEO makes no apology for company's tax strategy,1, WASHINGTON  Reuters  Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook made no apology on Tuesday for the iPad maker saving billions of dollars in US taxes through Irish subsidiaries and told lawmakers that his company backs corporate tax reform even though it may end up paying more   The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has found that Apple in 2012 alone avoided paying 9 billion in US taxes using a strategy involving three offshore units with no discernible tax home or residence Cook in his first congressional testimony since becoming Apple CEO in 2011 said his company is a major taxpayer handing over nearly 6 billion in cash to the US government in 2012 We expect to pay even more this year Cook said We pay all the taxes we owe But Senator Carl Levin chairman of the subcommittee and a veteran tax sleuth said Apple had sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance creating one Irish unit that paid no income taxes to any national tax authority for the past five years Levin said Apple used Ireland as a base for a web of offshore holding companies and negotiated a deal with the Irish government for a tax rate of less than 2 percent The top US corporate tax rate is 35 percent one of the worlds highest Cook said Apple did not depend on tax gimmicks We dont move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell our products back to the United States to avoid taxes We dont stash money on some Caribbean island he said In Ireland where low corporate taxes have been an economic development tool for many years the government said it had not made a special tax deal with Apple If Apples tax rate was too low it was the fault of other countries deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore told national broadcaster RTE on Tuesday White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday that President Barack Obama thinks it is inexplicable that our tax code would actually be written in a way that rewards companies for taking jobs and profits offshore HP MICROSOFT PRECEDED APPLE Subcommittee staffers said on Monday that Apple was not breaking any laws and had cooperated fully with the inquiry Levins panel has previously examined what it called tax avoidance by other US technology giants including HewlettPackard Co and Microsoft Corp The senator said Apple has used similar tax avoidance strategies Senator John McCain praised Apple as a success story but he said the companys tax strategy reflected a flawed tax system For years Apple has opted to forego fully contributing to the US Treasury and to American society by shifting profits and circumventing US taxes McCain said Cook said Apple agreed with those in Congress who want to reform corporate taxes and called for changes that include lower corporate income tax rates and a reasonable tax on foreign earnings Apple recognizes these and other improvements in the US corporate tax system may increase the companys taxes he said in prepared testimony Many US multinationals take advantage of a tax law that allows profits earned abroad to be taxfree as long as they are not brought into the United States or repatriated Total US corporate profits parked offshore rose 15 percent to 19 trillion last year according to research firm Audit Analytics Taking advantage of this law and others the offshore earnings of US companies have risen 70 percent in the past five years Audit Analytics said two weeks ago The baldness of the Apple strategy surprises me more than anything else said University of Southern California Law Professor Edward Kleinbard European member states are going to be very angry with Apple and very angry with Ireland OFFSHORE MANEUVERS Offshore profits are typically taxed by the countries in which they are earned but companies work hard to move offshore profits into countries with lower tax rates like Ireland One way this is done is through transfer pricing or the management of moving goods and services across international borders from one corporate unit to another Sometimes companies move valuable intellectual property to a lowtax country then bring profits derived from its use into that country through royalty payments and other structures Levins panel said Apple used a costsharing agreement to transfer valuable intellectual property assets offshore and shift the resulting profits to a tax haven jurisdiction Assessing taxes on these arrangements is one of the biggest challenges facing US tax collectors said Mark Mazur assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department who testified after Cook The panel also said Apple took advantage of loopholes in tax law and regulations known as check the box and look through that let some offshore units be disregarded for tax purposes sheltering substantial profits from taxation Levin has unsuccessfully called for closing the check the box and look through provisions of the tax code The Levin inquiry comes at a turbulent time in tax circles with the US Internal Revenue Service under investigation because of the way agents handled conservative political groups applications for taxexempt status It is not clear however whether that controversy and Levins allegations will lead to an overhaul of the US tax code Tax law writers in Congress had been inching forward on such a project before the IRS

749,Apple,5/22/2013,EU leaders talk tough on tackling Amazon Google over taxes,0, BRUSSELS  Reuters  Britain France and Germany called for stricter rules to stop companies such as Google Apple and Amazon aggressively avoiding taxes in austerity bitten Europe while acknowledging they had done nothing unlawful   At a summit to discuss energy and tax policy the leaders of the three largest EU countries took the opportunity at news conferences to lament the impact of corporate tax avoidance following several cases involving US firms The issue has hit a nerve in Europe where many countries are cutting back on social spending and squeezing workers in order to reduce national deficits and debt Most recently a US Senate report found that Apple Inc had paid just 2 percent tax on 74 billion in overseas income largely by exploiting a loophole in Irelands tax code We cannot accept that a certain number of companies can put themselves in situations where they escape paying taxes in ways that are legal French President Francois Hollande said We must coordinate at a European level harmonize our rules and come up with strategies to stop this British Prime Minister David Cameron who has put tax at the top of the agenda for a meeting of the G8 in Ireland next month was equally clear about the need for coordination steps There is a real chance of seeing the sort of international action that we need to fix this problem he said You cant do it on your own you have to have that international action and that is why I think today has been a bit of a breakthrough France and Britain in particular have grown concerned by the sheer scale of the legal tax schemes Mondays US Senate report on Apple Inc followed reports that the British unit of Amazon paid just 37 million tax on 2012 sales of 65 billion and similar revelations concerning the UK operations of Google and Starbucks In all officials estimate that EU governments miss out on around 1 trillion euros 13 trillion a year through the legal tax avoidance schemes employed by such companies and via illegal tax evasion German Chancellor Angela Merkel who avoided commenting on the issue ahead of the summit expressed her frustration that existing laws were not sufficient to capture taxes fully We will work towards ensuring companies have to pay more where they are based she told reporters saying that new rules would affect big companies most although it many cases companies are basing themselves in low or notax jurisdictions HARD TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES While there is common consent among EU leaders that action needs to be taken to close loopholes and level the playing field on tax policy little has been done on the issues despite regular lobbying by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and other international organizations In a report in March last year the OECD a club for wealthy countries set out in detail how companies were using hybrid mismatch arrangements to avoid paying taxes the very technique that Apple is alleged to have used in its tax planning We have got to make sure as we set those tax rates that companies pay taxes and that means international collaboration the sharing of tax information British Prime Minister David Cameron said as he arrived at the summit But officials have dismissed the possibility of immediate steps to close loopholes or any targeting of companies saying it is primarily up to EU member states to craft the necessary legislation and to work through wider international forums such as the OECD G8 and G20 to make progress and close the net Eversheds a global law firm dealing with tax issues said that while recent cases involving highprofile US companies had pushed the tax issue to the top of the global agenda it could not be tackled with any quick or immediate steps While the issues deserves this toplevel attention the public should not expect any gamechanging developments and indeed it would be wrong for the EU to try to tackle the issue on its own said Ben Jones a tax expert at the firm Uncoordinated attempts by individual countries or blocs of countries to tackle the issue may actually create more tax loopholes or have a detrimental impact on businesses that do not engage in aggressive tax planning France has already shown its willingness to take on major US companies with authorities raiding Google in a 2011 investigation into whether its Paris office conducts sales work The company was asked to pay 17 billion euros in back taxes A similar issue has arisen with how Google operates in Britain with questions raised about whether its sales staff are based abroad as the company maintains or in the country which would create a liability to UK tax Google says it follows tax rules everywhere it operates and that references to selling in job ads for Britishbased staff reflect the fact that it likes people with a sales skills Additional reporting by  Adrian Croft  and  Peter Griffiths  in

750,Apple,5/22/2013,Apple former Washington wallflower now at center of tax fight,0, WASHINGTON  Reuters  For years Apple Inc kept a low profile in Washington as it grew into one of the most valuable companies in the world Now the iPad maker has taken the lead perhaps inadvertently on a top priority for US business simplifying Americas tax code   Chief Executive Tim Cook who was called before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday to answer questions about Apples alleged tax avoidance used his appearance to plead for an overhaul of corporate taxes That marked a sharp turnabout for a company that until now has been content to let rivals like Google and Microsoft fight Washington policy battles And even though the scrutiny Apple has come under in Washington could further challenge the company as it copes with a sagging stock price rising competition and questions about its labor practices it may have little choice but to commit fully to the fight over the corporate tax code They are very very tactical said a former Apple lobbyist who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the company They only join issues they really care about Recently Apple has backed unsuccessful legislation that would have allowed international companies to bring overseas profits back home without paying the 35 percent corporate income tax Repatriation of profits has been a top concern for US companies which collectively have more than 15 trillion sitting offshore Most say they keep the money there to avoid the taxes they would face by bringing it home Bowing to increasing shareholder pressure to distribute some of the 100 billion it keeps overseas Apple has opted to borrow money at low interest rates rather than bring the cash home and take the tax hit Apples Washington office referred questions to its California headquarters Officials there declined to comment Apple has spent far less than other corporate titans on Washington lobbying over the past decade records show and the company has often declined to work with other technology companies on issues affecting the industry as a whole It dropped out of the US Chamber of Commerce in 2009 after it disagreed with the business lobbys stance on climate change The company spent about 2 million on lobbying last year up from 180000 in 1999 records show This year it is on pace to nearly double last years figure Apples lobbying expenditures still pale in comparison with those of Microsoft Corp which spent 81 million in 2012 and Google which spent 165 million records show And unlike other businesses such as ATT and Exxon Mobil Apple has not set up a political action fund to distribute employee contributions to congressional allies  a common tool for wielding influence in Washington Clearly Apple does not have a huge footprint for the tech sector I dont mean to denigrate almost 2 million spent onlobbying  thats a lot of money  but its not as much as other tech companies have been spending said Bill Allison editorial director for the Sunlight Foundation a nonprofit that deals with money in politics Lobbyists not associated with the firm privately said Apples minimal Washington presence could have put it in the crosshairs of the Senate subcommittee which on Monday accused the company of ducking 9 billion in US taxes through offshore subsidiaries The lobbyists pointed to the example of Microsoft which had little presence in Washington before antitrust investigators at the Department of Justice nearly succeeded in splitting the company up in the 1990s Though Apple like many other Silicon Valley companies served as an important source of campaign money for Democratic candidates in the 2012 election it has enlisted experienced Republicans to make its case in Washington Apples chief lobbyist Catherine Novelli served as a top trade official in Republican President George W Bushs administration Other inhouse lobbyists have worked as aides to senior Republican lawmakers including Texas Representative Joe Barton who used to oversee tech issues as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee records show The company also has hired outside firms to extend its reach in Congress and throughout government Lobbyists at Fierce Isakowitz  Blalock and Capitol Tax Partners have worked for the Bush administration and top Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell The Glover Park Group and the Franklin Square Group have provided lobbyists from the Democratic side of the aisle who lobby on tax broadband electronic waste and spectrum issues The company has also enlisted Jon Bernstein a former Democratic staffer at the Federal Communications Commission to lobby that agency and the White House on subsidies for broadband

764,Apple,6/20/2013,Investors hit hard as Apple bonds tank,0, June 20 IFR  Investors in Apples record US 17 billion bond deal have suffered some of the biggest losses in recent investmentgrade new issues with about 760 million wiped off the value of longermaturing Apple securities that they bought just weeks ago   The prices of the Apple 55 billion 24 percent 10year and the 3 billion 385 percent 30year bonds have plunged so much since the deal priced on April 30 that it would take about three years of earned interest from the coupons for investors to cover their losses Basically if you own this paper youre sitting on it for three years or selling at a loss said Rajeev Sharma senior portfolio manager at First Investors Management who bailed out of his position in the 10year at a loss some weeks ago T he staggering losses are a painful lesson to the vast number of unhedged total return investors that it takes more than just being comfortable with credit risk to play in the corporate bond markets The 10year note was trading on Thursday at 9250 close to 75 points lower than where it was issued At 95 basis points over Treasuries its yield spread has widened 20 basis points from the 75 basis points at issue The 30year has suffered even more with a more than 12point loss in dollar price It was quoted at 8760 and at a spread of 110 basis points or 10 basis points wider than its 100basis points level at launch This deal is great for shareholders because of the tight coupons Apple locked in to pay for dividends and share buybacks but everyone who didnt hedge out rate risk  the Moms and Pops who have money in totalreturn funds  are looking at dollar losses that will suck up a lot of coupon payments said one senior manager of a bond syndicate desk who was not involved in underwriting the deal Apple attracted a record 2000 orders worth 502 billion from 900 investors when it made its debut in the bond markets in late April when the 10year Treasury rate was 167 percent versus 24 percent today This is not Apples fault said the senior manager Its a fantastic credit This deal could not have been better timed or executed in terms of pricing And in terms of credit spreads its widened out  but not by as much as many other names in its sector BIG DEAL One of few big technology companies with no debt on its books Apple came to the bond market to raise funds for a 100 billion capital reward for shareholders including a 60 billion share buyback over the next few years The company under pressure from activist shareholders chose to issue bonds because borrowing rates were low  and to avoid the US corporate taxes that would be levied if it repatriated its offshore cash pile The spike in interest rates is the main factor behind the poor performance of the Apple bonds although they are also a victim of the size of the trade The bigger the size the more liquid the name  and the easier it is for mutual funds to finance redemptions by liquidating their Apple bonds It seems many investors who bought the longerdated tranches didnt realize that they were essentially buying rate risk said a senior portfolio manager of a total return fund We bought the floatingrate notes because there wasnt enough coupon to cushion against the risk of rising rates At the same time a proper market has yet to materialize for credit default swaps offering protection on Apple bonds Although activity has picked up since the bonds priced CDS remains illiquid and actual quotes and pricings are sparse Investors continue to be reluctant to make a market in any maturity other than the fiveyear and the spread remains rangebound where the indicative midpoint was originally derived at 25 basis points That has surprised some who cautioned from the outset that the 30year maturity was a surprising one for a technology name given the uncertain lifecycle of companies in that sector They said the view of Apple as cashrich and liquid an innovator that will produce musthave products for generations may have blinded some investors to the risk Apple may now face a more reticent investor base if it returns to the bond market for more cash to fund the shareholder program Its unfortunate because this name had so much traction said Sharma It really had a lot of investors waiting for it and the book was the largest ever seen But there was no follow through in terms of spread tightening after launch  and you would expect that when a deal is 15 times oversubscribed The 10year and the 30year did tighten and trade around launch spread after its pricing but have essentially been underwater for the bulk of the time since then Reporting by Danielle Robinson Editing by  Ciara Linnane ,59.900002,72.827141

774,Apple,7/24/2013,Apple wobbles in China as rivals offer more for less,1, SAN FRANCISCOHONG KONG  Reuters  A sharp drop in Apple Incs China revenue in AprilJune underscores the challenges it faces in its secondlargest market as the technology gap with cheaper local rivals narrows and as Samsung Electronics keeps up a steady stream of new models across all price ranges   While investors marked up Apple shares as the company sold more of its iPhones than expected the stock rally may prove shortlived as demand for its products fades in China Analysts predict Apple will lose market share in the worlds leading smartphone sector Theres some cannibalization of Apples market share from competitive midtier models that cost a lot less and perform as well from vendors such as Xiaomi and Vivo said Huang Leping an analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong referring to rival Chinese models Salespeople at several electronics shops in Hong Kong said South Koreas Samsung was a bigger hit with consumers as it offers more products Some display counters didnt carry any Apple devices Samsung products have enjoyed greater sales than Apple as many mainland Chinese tourists tend to buy Samsung due to a greater variety of models with a wider price range said a saleswoman at a Hong Kong computer centre Thats why we stock more Samsung products SLIPPING DOWN In the first quarter of this year Apple ranked top in Hong Kong with 46 percent market share in smartphones though that was down from 54 percent in the last quarter of 2012 according to market research firm Canalys Even without releasing a new product Apple sold 312 million iPhones in its fiscal third quarter around a fifth more than analysts had predicted But revenue from all Apple products in Greater China which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan slumped 43 percent from the previous quarter and was down 14 percent from a year earlier  worrying in a region where smartphone penetration is still low Greater China accounted for 13 percent of Apples sales or 5 billion in AprilJune  down from nearly 19 percent in the previous quarter Hong Kong was a particularly weak spot Its not totally clear exactly why that occurred CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts In the past three months the number of mainland Chinese consumers of Apple products dropped about 50 percent said Sunny Tang a salesperson at another Hong Kong electronics store that sells Apple products Android Googles operating system in many Samsung phones is much better than Apple and in that period Samsung released at least five phones and tablets Nicole Peng Luping at Canalys said China is a very diverse market so you need to have very diverse products to serve different levels of customers  and thats the weakness for Apple HEATING UP In the first quarter Apple ranked 5th in China with 97 percent market share well behind leader Samsung with 177 percent and lagging among others Lenovo Group Ltd and Huawei Technologies which said on Wednesday it was on track to hit 10 percent revenue growth this year Nomuras Huang expects Apples China market share to slip 12 percentage points in the coming quarters as the novelty of the iPhone 5 fades and as new buyers opt for cheaper smartphones The global battle for mobile supremacy is not just between Apple and Samsung Huawei and ZTE Corp are growing across their Chinese home base and South Koreas LG Electronics said on Wednesday it sold a record 121 million smartphones in AprilJune more than double its yearago sales As highend smartphone sales hit a plateau the 2 trillion industry  telecom carriers handset makers and content providers  is buckling up for a bumpier ride as growth shifts to emerging markets primarily in Asia Even excluding China Apples revenue in Asia Pacific fell 35 percent quarteronquarter CEO Cook who has seen Apple stock fall by more than a fifth so far this year blamed Chinas slowing economic growth but said he remained bullish on that market The economy clearly doesnt help us nor others he told analysts He said however that the revenue numbers dont tell the whole story Apple books revenue when it sells to resellers who then sell the products to consumers Sales to consumers  or sellthrough  slipped just 4 percent in Greater China from a year ago By that same measure mainland Chinese sellthrough sales actually rose 5 percent yearonyear though that was a deceleration in growth Cook said WEB TRAFFIC Beyond the Asia weakness Apples sales of its iPad  the device that catapulted tablet computing into the mainstream  underperformed Apple shipped 146 million tablets in AprilJune some way below rough estimates Some investors argue that Apples hold on a market it created is likely to slip as rival smartphone makers as well as Google and Amazoncom Inc pile in but Cook noted that usage data shows the iPad still commands a dominant share of Web traffic iPad accounts for 84 percent of the Web traffic from tablets he said So if there are lots of other tablets selling I dont know what they are being used for Given the pressures and increasing competition Apples stock rally should not be seen as proof that concerns over its outlook have abated some analysts said Its nice to see a bit of a beat for a change said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst But earnings are still down year over year Its going to take a new product

quarter Sales were weighed down by a sharp drop in revenues from Hong Kong Its not totally clear why that occurred Cook said on a conference call with analysts Neither is it totally clear what Apples strategy is to deal with Samsung  not to mention a host of smaller nimbler Chinese challengers Today in the war for what both sides acknowledge is the 21st centurys most important market Samsung is whipping its American rival The South Korean giant now has a 19 percent share of the 80 billion smartphone market in China a market expected to surge to 117 billion by 2017 according to International Data Corp IDC Thats 10 percentage points ahead of Apple which has fallen to 5th in terms of China market share Cook said Apple planned to double the number of its retail stores over the next two years  it currently has 8 flagship stores in China and 3 in Hong Kong But he added Apple will invest in distribution very cautiously because we want to do it with great quality Samsung with a longer history in China now has three times the number of retail stores as Apple and has been more aggressive in courting consumers and creating partnerships with phone operators It also appears to be in better

image translates in China  its stores are routinely packed  but hasnt been enough to overcome the more entrenched Samsung A stuffy electronics bazaar in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen illustrates part of the reason why Samsung Galaxys and Apple iPhones of different generations sit side by side glinting under bright display lights as vendors call out to get customers attention With

annually with different specifications and at different price points in China And those models analysts say are loaded with features tailored specifically for the local market apps such POCOcn the most popular photo sharing site in China or the two slots for SIM cards Apple offers one which allows service from multiple cell carriers either at home or abroad The Chinese just love features They want their phone to have 50 different things that theyre never going to use said Michael Clendenin managing director of technology consultancy RedTech Advisors Apple just doesnt play that game Unfortunately if you want to hit the mainstream market in China and you want a lot of market share percentage points you have to offer the Swiss army knife of cellphones SETTING THE PACE Analysts believe Samsungs increasing strength in China is a critical reason behind its rivals possible intention to introduce globally a new and cheaper iPhone model as well as one with bigger screens  a staple of Samsungs offerings Said a Samsung executive with experience in China We definitely think were setting the pace there They are having to respond to us Most audaciously Samsung has gone after Apple not simply by offering lower priced smartphones but by attacking its rival directly in the pricier end of the market We put a lot of emphasis on the high end market in China coCEO JK Shin told Reuters in an interview Samsung launched a Chinaonly luxury smartphone together with China Telecom marketed by actor Jackie Chan that retails for about 12000 yuan 2000 The flip phone named heart to the world is encased in a slim black and rose gold metal body The sleek look  called da qi elegantly grand  is coveted by Chinese when they shop for cars sofas or phones There are a lot of VVIPs in China and for them we launched luxury phones promoted by Jackie Chan This helps target niche customers and build brand equity said Lee Younghee executive vice president of Samsungs mobile business While Samsung wont sell millions of these smartphones the creation of the phone in conjunction with a carrier reinforces Samsungs willingness to go local  and tap into niche markets The key point is that Samsung consistently adapts to the local market said TZ Wong a Singaporebased technology analyst with IDC Apples latest mobile operating system offers links to popular Chinese applications like Sinas microblogging platform Weibo but the application itself must be downloaded onto the phone On all of Samsungs entries its already there People know intellectually that Samsung is from Korea but when it comes to the messaging there is always a local face Wong said RETAIL PRESENCE Samsung opened its first office in China in 1985 in Beijing  an era in which it was all but inconceivable that Apple and Samsung would end up in one of the worlds most intense corporate grudge matches Like other South Korean chaebols Samsung was a first mover in China using the market primarily as a base to produce electronics for the world In contrast Apples big push in China came only recently with the advent of the smartphone age roughly five years ago The early entry gave Samsung an undeniable edge and it adapted fast to a rapidly changing environment By the mid1990s with the economy booming Samsung made the strategic decision to treat the Chinese market not just as a production base but to start marketing to China higherpriced electronics said Nomura researcher Choi Changhee who wrote a history of Samsungs experience in China That shift has meant Samsungs retail presence in China far outstrips Apples Aside from selling via the distribution outlets of the three major telecom carriers Samsung also has a strong retail presence through its partners Gome Electrical Appliances and Suning Commerce Group as well as its own Experience stores and small retailers all over the country Apple works through the same channels but its relatively late entry means it has a significantly smaller presence Samsung for example has more than 200 official distributors and resellers in Guangzhou province while Apple lists 95 Over the last two decades Samsung has also taken pains to build relationships with Chinese government officials and perhaps more critically  the three major telecom carriers The notion of the importance of connections  or guanxi  in China is occasionally overrated in business Not according to Samsungs Shin in this case Its our core policy to keep friendly relationships with the operators he said In China each carrier uses a different technology and that requires Samsung to tweak our smartphones to their request Its not easy Shin said but we do this to be more operator friendly Contrast that with the ongoing negotiations Apple has had with China Mobile the largest cellphone operator For years the two sides have been unable to come to an agreement on revenue sharing effectively precluding Apple from hundreds of millions of potential customers SCRUTINY FROM THE TOP Samsungs reach extends higher than just the CEOs of the top stateowned telecom companies Top executives have met each of the last several Chinese leaders most recently Xi Jinping who spent time in April with vice chairman Jay Y Lee son of KH Lee Samsung Electronics chairman What surprised me most said Lee later was that they Chinese leadership know very well about Samsung They even have a group studying us The Chinese government has also made clear its well aware of Apple  though not always in a good way In April state media bashed Apple for its arrogance protesting among other things that its current 1year service warranty was insufficient Apple initially dismissed those criticisms but Cook later apologized to Chinese consumers Samsungs success in China has its roots one former executive said in a previous obsession for the company its desire not to replicate the mistakes made by Japanese rivals Samsung spent a lot of time benchmarking Sony Toshiba and Panasonic said Mark Newman who spent six years in Samsungs global strategy group and is now an industry analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong One of the things that came out of that is the realization that the insular approach has its drawbacks and so Samsung has made an effort over the last 10 years to be much more global This strategy of decentralization is plainly evident in China he said home now to more Samsung employees than any country outside South Korea FIGHTING HIGH AND LOW Samsung now leads in both lowend and highend segments in China according to IDC and its logic of going after both ends of the market is straightforward In China where the average wage is roughly 640 per month many users looking to upgrade from feature phones to smartphones cannot afford Apple By bracketing the market with multiple models Samsung can breed deep relationships with customers many of whom market research shows trade up to more expensive models as they get older Playing high and low also positions Samsung to fend off the intensifying competition from Chinese firms such as Lenovo and Huawei and literally hundreds of smaller local players Thats where the next battle for Samsung will be fought said Newman Well have to see if Apple does introduce a new cheaper model for China  and the world Writing by Bill Powell Editing by Bill Tarrant and  Ian Geoghegan ,62.185715,75.044289

that tough new restrictions be imposed on the company for illegally conspiring to raise ebook prices   The changes proposed by the US Department of Justice and 33 US states and territories are designed to stop Apple from committing further antitrust violations after US District Judge Denise Cote on July 10 said Apple had a central role in a conspiracy with five major publishers to raise ebook prices Under the departments proposed order Apples illegal conduct will cease and Apple and its senior executives will be prevented from conspiring to thwart competition said Bill Baer head of the Justice Departments antitrust division Apple is fighting back In a court filing it called the proposed injunction a draconian and punitive intrusion into its business that would hurt consumers and competition and that it was wildly out of proportion The resulting cost of this relief  not only in dollars but also lost opportunities for American businesses and consumers  would be vast it said Cote will weigh both the arguments at an August 9 hearing in her Manhattan courtroom A damages trial might follow Despite Apples protests analysts have said the bigger issue for the Cupertino Californiabased company in this case might be damage to its reputation not financial harm Amazoncom Inc commands about 65 percent of the US ebooks market while Apples share has been estimated in the single digits LIMITS ON DEAL MAKING The governments plan which still needs court approval would require that Apple end its contracts with the five publishers and be banned for five years from entering contracts that would effectively the raise prices of ebooks sold by rivals The publishers included Lagardere SCAs Hachette Book Group Inc News Corps HarperCollins Publishers LLC Pearson Plcs Penguin Group USA Inc CBS Corps Simon  Schuster Inc and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbHs Macmillan All settled with US regulators Apple would also be blocked from cutting deals with providers of movies music and TV programs for its iPad tablets and iPhones that would likely increase the prices at which rivals might sell such content It would also require providers to lower prices for Apple if they lower them for rivals Officials also want to make it easier for consumers to compare ebook prices by requiring Apple for two years to let Amazon Barnes  Noble Inc and other rivals provide links to their own stores within their iPad and iPhone apps The proposal should solidify online retailer Amazoncom Incs dominance in the ebooks market The DOJ proposal hands Amazon yet another win said Mark Coker founder of Smashwords an ebook publisher and distributor that works with Apple Barnes  Noble Sony and others Why isnt the DOJ forcing Amazon to play fairly This is the question the publishing industry wants answered Apple brought muchneeded competition to the ebook market and now the government is trying to undermine them Albert Greco a bookindustry expert at the business school of Fordham University said the remedy proposed by the department of justice does not address the long term issue of book pricing in the United States While the trial was fair I am not sure they looked at the book publishing industry in much detail he said adding that it is unclear how it will impact the industry broadly Under the proposal Apple would also be required to hire a fulltime internal antitrust compliance officer and employ a courtappointed external monitor to ensure its compliance with antitrust law Government officials said the changes would permit Apple to compete vigorously and lawfully in the ebooks market Apple countered that the changes seek unnecessary relief for harm already remedied under the settlements with the publishers and impose broad invasive and vague requirements unrelated to Cotes findings It urged Cote to reject the injunction entirely or approve a narrower and more modest alternative APPLE SEIZED THE MOMENT Federal and state officials accused Apple of conspiring with the publishers in late 2009 and early 2010 as the iPad was being launched They said the conspiracy caused some ebook prices to rise to 1299 or 1499 from the 999 that Amazon charged Evidence damaging Apples case included emails from Steve Jobs its chief executive that the officials said reflected a desire to boost prices Taking advantage of the publisher defendants fear of and frustration over Amazons pricing Cote concluded Apple seized the moment and brilliantly played its hand In their settlements the publishers agreed to pay more than 166 million for consumers benefit

trade at 700 a share Icahn said in a phone interview Apple has huge borrowing power little relative debt and trades at a low multiple Icahn who this year launched an assault on Michael Dells 25 billion effort to take Dell Inc private did not say how many shares of Apple he holds A source familiar with the matter who declined to be named because Icahn hasnt disclosed his holdings in Apple said the investors stake was worth around 1 billion a fraction of the companys market value of more than 400 billion US rules require investors to disclose stakes of 5 percent or larger within 10 days of hitting that threshold In April Apple bowed to Wall Street pressure and said it would return 100 billion to shareholders by the end of 2015  double the amount set aside previously It got there in part by raising its dividend 15 percent and boosting its share buyback program sixfold to 60 billion one of the largest of its kind The news gave Apple shares a lift but they remain down more than 30 percent since hitting a record high of 70210 in September 2012 pummeled by fears of slowing growth and thinning margins amid competition from Samsung Electronics We currently have a large position in Apple We believe the company to be extremely undervalued Icahn said in one of two tweets about Apple on Tuesday Had a nice conversation with Tim Cook today Discussed my opinion that a larger buyback should be done now We plan to speak again shortly he said in his second tweet Icahn is the second prominent activist to target Apple this year The company had averted a dispute with hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital who sued Apple to try to block a proposal regarding voting on preferred shares Apple eventually withdrew the proposal Einhorns 8 billion hedge fund is a major shareholder and owned about 24 million shares of the company as of the end of the first quarter We appreciate the interest and investment of all our shareholders Apple said in a statement on Tuesday in response to Icahns tweets Tim had a very positive conversation with Mr Icahn today STILL EDGY ENOUGH Analysts said Icahns interest in Apple helped cement improving sentiment on the stock as investors began to anticipate a new lineup of gadgets in the fall including possibly a cheaper iPhone that can spearheard a deeper drive into fastgrowing emerging markets Speculation has persisted also that the company may be planning some sort of TV or smartwatch product  worn on the users wrist  in the near future Cook said last month there will be products in new categories but gave no details Apple bought about more than 16 billion worth of stock in the June quarter much more than analysts had expected Its a heavyweight investor who can maybe accelerate the buyback program said Morningstar analyst Brian Collelo It helps the positive momentum that Apple has seen Others say they saw little need for Apple to expand or speed up its buyback program Much of the companys 147 billion in cash is held overseas and that cash cannot be accessed without incurring taxes As an alternative Apple raised debt to bankroll its buyback program It was already greatly increased and there was a debt offering to facilitate that Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst said I cant say that I agree that the pace of the buyback is tepid Investors biggest longterm concern about Apple is whether the company has lost its innovative edge Product innovation and profitability are now top priorities Ernst said Apples profit fell 22 percent in the June quarter as gross margins slid below 37 percent from over 42 percent a year earlier On Tuesday about 31 million Apple shares changed hands almost three times the recent daily average The stock is now up nearly 20 from its 200day moving

its latest iPhone on Tuesday with many building bullish share and options positions   In the past two weeks Apple investors have bought almost twice the number of call options than puts on three major US option exchanges Apple on Tuesday is holding a media event at its headquarters in Cupertino California where it is expected to launch an updated iPhone model  widely referred to as the iPhone 5S  as well as a cheaper version of the device dubbed the iPhone 5C Investors are hoping that in addition to the phone unveiling the company will also announce it has finally penetrated the worlds largest wireless carrier China Mobile Ltd which has over 740 million users Currently Apple phones are supported by Chinese telecom carriers China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd and China Telecom Corp Ltd which has a combined subscriber base of 266 million Apple is effectively only selling to half the Chinese market today said Brian Colello analyst with Morningstar They can essentially double their sales in China quickly with China Mobile So its a big deal But Colello also cautioned that many investors could have already bought the stock in the hope of a deal with China Mobile and could sell off if the deal does not materialize in the near term Also Apple shares typically sell off on major product unveiling and Tuesdays iPhone launch could mark the same trend Jefferies analyst Peter Misek expects choppy trading of Apple shares following the event as he expects lackluster sales of the phone Lack of differentiation elongating replacement rates and smartphone growth shifting to the very lowend below the iPhone 5C price point are the negatives he said Apple shares are down 29 percent since hitting a record high of 70210 in September 2012 fueled by fears of slowing growth and thinning margins amid competition from Samsung Electronics and other manufacturers of cheaper Androidbased smartphones Apples stock has seen upward momentum recently sparked by hedge fund billionaire Carl Icahns revelation last month that he had taken a large position in Apple and was pushing for the company to expand its program of share buybacks He has said the stock could rise to as much as 700 a share if Chief Executive Tim Cook pushed for a larger stock buyback Icahn who is having dinner with Cook this month said on Monday on CNBC television that Apple shares are very undervalued and buying the stock was a nobrainer If you look at the numbers look at the multiples that are going on look at the great cash flow they have  you really have a lot of protection on the downside he said Wall Streets 12month target share for Apple ranges from a median estimate of 530 to as high as 825 according to Thomson One The shares closed on Monday up 16 percent at 50617 HIGH BAR While many options investors are taking an optimistic view expecting Apple to build on recent gains that have driven the stock up nearly 25 percent since the end of June some analysts cautioned the market may be overpricing expected volatility in Apple shares Ryan Detrick senior technical analyst at options research firm Schaeffers Investment Research in Cincinnati Ohio said that in the past 10 trading sessions beginning August 23 investors bought 198 call options on Apple compared with every put option purchased as a new position citing data from three major US options exchanges That calltoput ratio is higher than 94 percent of the readings over the past year he said This optimism sets a rather high bar and any disappointment could lead to profit taking or selling Detrick said Options action in Apple on Monday suggests a swing of about 34 percent in the shares based on the weekly options expiring this Friday That is above the average 14 percent absolute oneday move for the previous five iPhone announcements according to Credit Suisse data If history is any guide the release of a new iPhone will be a relative nonevent for the stock said Terry Wilson equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse in a report on Monday A total of 407000 options traded on Apple on Monday about 100000 contracts fewer than normal according to options analytics firm Trade Alert Out of that 275000 were calls contracts which grant the right to buy a stock at a specific price by a given date and are often used to express bullish sentiment A put conveys the right to sell the shares at a preset price About 46 percent of the total volume was in the weekly options expiring this Friday led by the 500 510 and 520 strike calls Trade Alert data shows The September 500 call strike has the most open interest of any

799,Apple,9/10/2013,Early China iPhone launch gives smugglers a run for their money,0, HONG KONG  Reuters  Apple Incs millions of Chinese fans will celebrate the nearsimultaneous launch of the latest iPhone in China and the United States but one group will have little to cheer  the smugglers   An early launch of Apples latest smartphone in China is expected to stifle a thriving grey market worth billions of dollars a year built around smuggling from Hong Kong where in the past the US tech giants gadgets have gone on sale months before they reach official channels in the mainland Smugglers also worry that once Apple and China Mobile Ltd sign a longawaited deal it will snatch away more business with the carriers heavily subsidized smartphones Of course it will affect our business in some way If people can buy it at the official stores soon why will they still want to buy it here said Huang Kaidi a shopkeeper in Chinas southern city of Shenzhen who has been selling iPhones smuggled from Hong Kong since the phone debuted in 2007 But price is still our advantage Our price will still be cheaper and consumers are always looking for cheaper ones said Huang one of the hundreds of shop owners squeezed in the dimly lit smokefilled electronics marketplace The unveiling of Apples latest phone this week comes as the company is grappling with falling sales in Greater China its secondlargest market due to the narrowing technology gap with cheaper Chinese rivals and as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd keeps up a steady stream of new models across all price ranges When the iPhone 5 was launched last September Chinese authorities only gave the green light for sales at Apple stores and authorized resellers in December giving smugglers an advantage of several months to lure diehard fans A weak Hong Kong dollar and virtual taxfree regime also helped create a lucrative arbitrage opportunity Roughly 70 percent of iPhones and iPads sold in Hong Kong or 45 billion of Apples annual sales of 68 billion in the Chinese territory land up in China via either the grey market or mainland tourists purchases according to analysts BEIJING FIRST This time things will be different On Wednesday for the first time Apple is holding an event in Beijing hours after the US unveiling of its latest iPhone underscoring the importance of the Chinese market Two of Apples carrier partners  China Unicom and China Telecom  have already said they will carry the newest iPhone models within days of their launch China Mobile the worlds biggest carrier by subscribers is expected to seal a deal with Apple shortly after the launch some industry executives said Once China Mobile signs a contract with Apple that will also take away some business from the grey market said Bryan Wang an analyst with Forrester Research in Beijing While the early launch is seen hampering the smuggling trade it wont wipe it out totally The market will not be fully diminished because a sizeable portion of consumers on the Chinese operators network will still want to buy a new phone themselves before their contract runs out Wang said Consumers on prepaid tariffs will have to buy the phones without the operators subsidies if they cannot wait for their contract to run out So while the smugglers are losing out on the time advantage and price premiums they are still taking no chances Laying the groundwork for Wednesdays launch an ad posted on Alibaba Groups Taobaocom offered Hong Kong students to help you buy iPhone 5 5S 5C with the latest editions priced at 50007000 yuan 8201100 apiece Student mules from Hong Kong typically carry iPads in their schoolbags or strap iPhones around their waists and ankles each time they cross the border In Shenzhen smugglers promise to have the new iPhones at their counters as soon as it is launched in Hong Kong Come again on the day of the launch I guarantee the goods will arrive from Hong Kong by early afternoon In the meantime why dont you consider getting an iPhone 5 Im selling them real cheap to get rid of my leftover stock said a Shenzhen shopkeeper surnamed Zhou selling iPhone 5 models at a 25 percent discount 1  61210 Chinese yuan Editing by  Alex Richardson ,72.314285,68.561432
800,Apple,9/10/2013,Apple's two new iPhones target high low-end markets,0, CUPERTINO California  Reuters  Apple Inc unveiled a highend iPhone with a fingerprint scanner as it tries to stand out in a crowded market and a cheaper colorful plastic model for emerging markets that proved pricier than expected   Apple did not disclose pricing in China its largest market or whether it had sealed a longawaited distribution agreement with China Mobile Ltd although pricing is likely to be released at a Beijing media event scheduled for later on Wednesday Details of the two models the 5S and the 5C had been telegraphed ahead of time in several media reports leaving the launch devoid of major surprises and Apple shares dropped more than 2 percent The iPhone 5C comes in five colors  blue green pink yellow and white  and starts at 99 with a contract US phones are also available for 549 without a contract a higherthanexpected price that is important because many emerging markets sell such socalled unlocked phones Actual prices in emerging markets have not been disclosed Previously we thought the 5C would be a lowerend phone to address emerging markets like China and India said Gene Munster analyst with Piper Jaffray adding that based on the price it appears that Apple still plays in the higher end of the market The pricier 5S begins at 199 with a contract and also comes in three colors  gray silver and gold  and sports expected improvements in processor speed an improved camera along with a fingerprintscanner that can unlock the phone with just a touch Apart from a more powerful processor than in the 5C it embraces other cuttingedge features such as a dedicated M7 Motion coprocessor chip which can track motion data continuously without heavily draining the battery The chip opens the door for the iPhone to better track sports and fitnessrelated user activity For me this is an Apple brilliance where you see them going after the wearable device in a way that makes sense to them today which is by not adding a device that is not ready from a design perspective said Carolina Milanesi an analyst with Gartner who added that this chip will help Apple learn from consumers and help prepare the developers for any eventual Apple entry into the space Apple stock had gained more than 11 percent over the past month in a rally that typically happens ahead of a big product launch We are just seeing an aspect of device numbing or resistance meaning it takes more and more to thrill and excite the consumer said Jonathan Kanterman an independent alternative investment consultant Are you going to go out and upgrade to the new 5S if you just bought a new iPhone within the past year Probably not BLUE GREEN AND GOLD The cheaper phone goes on sale online on Friday while the pricier gadget can be preordered on September 20 For the first time it will sell in China at the same time as in the United States a move expected to severely curtail the underground market for smuggled phones in the worlds No 2 economy The broader color palette and lower price for Apples flagship product mark a departure from its reliance on a premium brand and familiar black and white gadgets The worlds most valuable tech company is trying to beat back rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in markets including India and China where it is quickly losing ground It means Apple will hold on to margins but clearly they are not going after the very lowend of the market which will disappoint some investors said Shannon Cross of Cross Research This is their first foray into multiple colors and the plastic back Keep in mind by next year they would have probably have discounted this down so I think theres still opportunity As expected iOS7 improvements are largely incremental Nothing transformational but iOS7 wasnt expected to be DoubleLine portfolio manager Brendt Stallings told Reuters We didnt expect iOS7 to be revolutionary and I dont think consensus did either Look for 64bit iPad in the near future said Stallings whose DoubleLine bought Apple shares at around 405 CEO Tim Cook told an expectant crowd at the companys Cupertino headquarters he expects Apple to ship the 700 millionth device  an iPhone or iPad  based on iOS mobile software sometime next month Wall Street approves of his move to offer a more basic version of the device although some investors warned initially that it would reduce margins and potentially tarnish a brand that has been linked to premium users since its 2007 inception Now they hope a bigger emergingmarket presence can help reverse a 29 percent fall in the companys share price since it hit a record high of 70210 a year ago The selloff was fueled by fears of slowing growth and a perception that Apples ability to innovate and shake up industries was dwindling The new iPhones coupled with a belief that Apple will announce a deal with the worlds largest carrier in China have spurred investors to build bullish share and options positions in the company over the past two weeks Also sparking Apples upward momentum was hedge fund billionaire Carl Icahns revelation last month that he had taken a large position and was pushing for the company to expand its program of share buybacks He has said the stock may rise to as much as 700 if Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pushed for a larger buyback Reuters Insider video The big money betting on Apple  linkreuterscomseg92v  Industry observers said Apple had not turned out a categorydefining electronic device since late cofounder Steve Jobs made a bet on the iPad in 2010 Speculation revolves around a smartwatch along the same lines as Samsungs recently introduced Galaxy Gear or some sort of TV product A NEW ERA But analysts said neither was likely to generate numbers anywhere in the neighborhood of the iPhone which supplies half of Apples revenue and is the companys highestmargin product Since the first touchscreen iPhone hit the market in 2007 software features have become easier to replicate and improvements in speed weight display size and resolution have become routine The explosion of metoo products is already hurting profit margins and nibbling at Apple and Samsungs market share Apple needs to demonstrate in the coming months that it has other product lines which can start to make up for slowing growth and falling margins in the iPhone and iPad said Jan Dawson a chief telecoms analyst for Ovum Research Thats a tall order More immediately Apple will get a boost if it succeeds in enlisting China Mobile in its iPhone network For the first time the company will host media in Beijing just nine hours after its Cupertino California launch spurring speculation it will announce a distribution agreement with the Chinese carrier The worlds largest wireless carrier serves more than 740 million users and is perceived as more amenable to carrying the popular smartphone now that profit and subscriber growth are decelerating Net income grew just 2 percent in the quarter that ended in June Separately Japans largest carrier NTT DoCoMo will sell the new iPhone Additional reporting by

801,Apple,9/11/2013,High iPhone price spooks investors Apple shares drop,1, Reuters  Apple Incs new iPhones got panned by Wall Street on Wednesday as investors decried one model for being too costly for emerging markets such as China and dismissed the other model as lacking enough gamechanging features   The worlds most valuable technology company missed an opportunity to introduce a lowend smartphone to drive sales in Asia where Samsung Electronics and Chinas Huawei have a wide lead over Apple analysts say The plastic iPhone 5C unveiled on Tuesday will sell for 4488 yuan 730 in China Apple said That is more than the average monthly urban income in China and about double the cost of midtier devices from Samsung and other vendors The cheapest phones in China made by the likes of Xiaomi go for about 100 apiece Investors were put off that Apples price point didnt go low enough to attract a new market It doesnt have the same range in price that Apples competitors have said Mark Luschini chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia which manages about 58 billion in assets The highend iPhone 5S disappointed Wall Street and revived fears that Apples most innovative days may be behind it The phone has a fingerprint scanner to improve security but analysts said that was not likely to be enough to make the iPhone 5S a sure win in the crowded smartphone market There was nothing transformational announced It has the fingerprint scan and new colors but bigger features like different screen sizes dont seem to be at the ready This was less than expected from a company that has a reputation for surprising with a killer product or strategy said Luschini Shares of Apple slid 54 percent to close at a month low of 46771 on the Nasdaq after at least three brokerages downgraded their rating on the stock Still Apple remains up 18 percent since the start of July when anticipation about the phones began building Apple executives  and the companys many fans in the industry  maintain both iPhones are bestinclass While the corporation itself has not addressed the uproar over its iPhone 5Cs price tag some analysts say its a good move to preserve margins while leaving room for future reductions WAITING FOR CHINA MOBILE China is critical to Apples growth prospects as its biggest market after the United States Apple fell to No 7 in the second quarter in China with a 5 percent market share losing ground not just to Samsung but also to local rivals such as Lenovo and ZTE Early signs point to a lukewarm Chinese response to the new iPhones Only 26 percent of 35000 Chinese consumers surveyed by Web portal Sinacom said they would consider buying the 5C We worry that Apples inability or unwillingness to come out with a lowpriced offering for emerging markets nearly ensures that the company will continue to be an overall share loser in the smartphone market until it chooses to address the low end Sanford C Bernstein analysts said in a note Wall Street is banking on Apple securing a partnership deal with China Mobile Ltd soon granting the iPhone more than 740 million potential buyers Some investors were disappointed that a deal was not announced on Tuesday Still the iPhone 5C carries a total component cost of 165 versus the 199 of the lastgeneration iPhone 5 and 236 for Samsungs toptier Galaxy S4 smartphone according to IHS iSupplis preliminary estimates  suggesting there is room to cut prices if warranted Rather than offer attractive pricing for consumers and move the iPhone 5C into a new and growing price segment Apple retained a premium pricing strategy in targeting the 400800 smartphone segment Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note This segment is not forecast to see meaningful growth long term This decision at the margin is good for profitability but not growth Apples profit for the quarter ended June 29 fell 22 percent as gross margins fell below 37 percent from more than 42 percent in the yearearlier quarter Garcha estimated that Apples share of the global smartphone market would fall to 155 percent this year and 131 percent next year from 181 percent in 2012 OVERSOLD Some analysts said Wednesdays selloff in Apple shares may have been overblown Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey said Apple may have ensured stable margins for the next couple of quarters by pricing the 5C in the United States at 99 with a contract and 549 without Saying the 5C was nobodys lowmargin phone Cowen and Co analyst Timothy Arcuri noted that Apples new relationship with Japans NTT DoCoMo Inc plus the expected tieup with China Mobile supported the view that Wall Streets estimates for Apple earnings in 2014 looked too low Arcuri said gross margins for the 5C appeared to be as high as in the mid50 percent area Raymond James and Associates maintained its strong buy recommendation on the stock and raised its share price target to 675 from 600 based on expected demand for the lowerend iPhone coupled with the NTT DoCoMo relationship and the preservation of gross margins Canaccord Genuity kept its buy rating on the stock and raised its target price to 550 from 530 citing Apples aggressive

802,Apple,9/12/2013,Insight: Trigger Finger - Apple fires biometrics into the mainstream,1, SINGAPORESAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  By adding a fingerprint scanner to its newest mobile phone Apple Inc is offering a tantalizing glimpse of a future where your favorite gadget might become a biometric pass to the workplace mobile commerce or realworld shopping and events   Although Apples executives said at Tuesdays launch that its Touch ID technology embedded into the iPhone 5S home button would only provide fingerprint access to the phone and its own online stores analysts said Apples embrace of such technology called biometrics would be key to wider adoption It really propels biometrics into the mainstream said specialist Alan Goode the UKbased managing director of research consultancy Goode Intelligence Jonathan Ive Apples senior vice president of design hinted of its future in a video presentation at the launch Touch ID defines the next step of how you use your iPhone he said making something as important as security so effortless and so simple Passwords and personal identification numbers PINs have long been the mainstay of access to devices bank accounts and online services despite their poor record Many passwords can easily be guessed while others can be hacked by bruteforce attacks  essentially a computer program running through all possible permutations They also involve one too many steps for lots of users Apple said that half of smartphone users dont bother to passwordprotect their devices Hence the appeal of biometrics which take something unique to the individual  a fingerprint an iris voice or facial features  as authentication COMFORT FOR COMMERCE Apples move may not have an immediate impact beyond improving the way users unlock their devices and interact with Apple services like iTunes and its App Store But that is itself a significant step Apple has more than 500 million iTunes accounts Anything that increases security and removes steps in the payment process is bound to boost online purchases It will also raise the comfort levels of companies supplying the content to a mobile commerce sector expected to reach 40 billion next year in the United States alone according to Euromonitor estimates Users afraid of using their mobile device to make purchases online or in the real world because they fear it will be stolen or their password seen may feel liberated using a fingerprint said Michael Chasen CEO of SocialRadar which is building locationbased mobile applications for social networking For mobile commerce he said that could be the missing piece Beyond the web Apple could combine the Touch ID with its existing Passbook app that stores coupons tickets to events and boarding passes on an iPhone and allow event organizers and airline companies to validate those documents said Sebastien Taveau chief technology officer at Californiabased Validity Sensors which makes sensors for other manufacturers Apple wants to make deals with music and entertainment companies with very strong opinions on digital rights management Taveau said The fingerprint scanner when used in transactions with these companies could reassure all these industries Biometric security should also appeal to enterprises nervous about allowing the personal devices of employees on the office network analysts and industry insiders said If this has been implemented right every enterprise that enforces a password or PIN lock on the device will begin using the fingerprint sensor instead said Song Chuang Singaporebased research director at Gartner Apple is not the first to try to make biometrics work for the consumer Fingerprint scanners have already found their way into laptops external harddrives and electronic wallets Companies like Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc Fujitsu Ltd and Pantech Co Ltd have incorporated fingerprint scanners into their mobile phones But none has really taken off Partly thats because of cost and partly because theres been little in the way of an ecosystem to build support for the products Biometrics have been historically viewed as a more expensive nice to have component rather than a must have said Bill Morelli an analyst at IHS Also fingerprint scanners have tended to make things harder rather than easier for users Chuang at Gartner said it could take users up to six swipes for a sensor to learn a users fingerprint This is not a great user experience he said All things say some that Apple was put on this earth to fix Ben Thompson a Taipeibased industry observer who writes a blog at stratecherycom said Apple was focusing on the apparently trivial problem of entering a password  but one that irked users dozens of times a day Its classic Apple to expend tremendous energy on simplifying a small irritation even if its not a classic feature list item BADLY KEPT SECRET BOOSTS INDUSTRY The badly kept secret of Apples biometric plans had already given the industry a boost long before Tuesday The company has been filing patents on biometric security since at least 2009 Apple has been working on it for more than two years and they have extremely competent engineers said Validitys Taveau Apple reached out two to three years ago to Microlatch an Australian company to license and test its peripheral fingerprint sensors Apple asked it to build a Bluetooth connection to the phone and accompanying software Microlatch managing director and founder Chris Burke said so Apple could gauge user reactions and habits particularly in ecommerce strongholds like China In their roadmap it was clear there would be fingerprint scans so theyd plot their course rather than just trying something Burke said in a phone interview Last year Apple also paid about 350 million for AuthenTec a key player in fingerprint sensors and until its purchase a supplier to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd HewlettPackard Co Dell Inc Lenovo Group Ltd and Fujitsu Apples moves have reawakened interest in the space Swedish biometric component maker Fingerprint Cards AB for example has seen its share price rise 1400 percent in the past year The company predicts the industry will ship up to 100 million consumer electronic devices embedded with fingerprint scanners this year rising to more than 1 billion in 2015 as biometrics finds its way into TV remotes gaming consoles and cameras DOWNSIDE OF NICE NOT NECESSARY There are downsides to fingerprint technology It is not as accurate as companies touting its benefits make it sound and PINs and passwords can be reset or changed if someone steals them Fingerprint recognition is not perfect said Geppy Parziale biometrics expert and CEO of Invasivecode a firm that develops applications for Apples mobile devices Then theres the problem of the fingerprints themselves acquiring a large enough set of them to test the accuracy of such devices is complicated by privacy and legal issues Parziale said But if anyone can bring this technology into the mainstream experts say its Apple It has for example embedded the scanner into the iPhones home button while other mobile devices usually have it on the back making it awkward for the user and increasing the number of failed attempts Samsung and fellow South Korean electronics manufacturer LG Electronics Inc have had problems incorporating the technology into finished products LGs head of domestic marketing Ma ChangMin last month said the company had abandoned efforts to include a fingerprint sensor to the back cover of its flagship G2 smartphone as we need more work to improve reliability and usability That gives Apple a headstart It can also build the sensing and security deep into its operating system and the A7 mobile chip which Apple itself designed putting it ahead of rivals such like Google which develops the Android mobile OS and licenses it to manufacturers like Samsung said Taipeibased KGI Securities analyst MingChi Kuo But its edge may not last Microsoft Corp for one is building fingerprint recognition into the latest update of its Windows operating system and said Taveau of Validity Sensors it is fair to assume that the Android community wont be long to react Additional Reporting By Clare Jim in TAIPEI and Miyoung Kim in SEOUL Editing by Matt Driskill,66.928574,66.715714

804,Apple,9/23/2013,Apple polishes forecast after selling 9 million new iPhones,0, Reuters  Apple Inc sold 9 million new iPhones during their first three days in stores after China joined the list of launch countries for the first time prompting the company to issue a rosier financial forecast   Shares in the company closed up 5 percent at 49064 on Monday after the company said revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter would gravitate towards the high end of its previous forecast for 34 billion to 37 billion Apple which began selling the toptier iPhone 5s and cheaper multihued iPhone 5c on Friday rarely adjusts its outlook in the middle of a quarter Since CEO Tim Cook took the reins however the worlds largest tech company has begun to court Wall Street more visibly The record sales and beefedup forecast reinforced expectations of strong demand for Apples latest gadgets Phones based on Google Incs Android software and made by the likes of Samsung Electronics have steadily eroded its market share as customers flocked to lower prices and larger phone sizes proved popular Critics had also said the iPhone 5c was priced too high to take advantage of pentup demand in emerging markets The critics have told you Apple lost its magic said Daniel Ernst an analyst with Hudson Square Research Customers are telling you something very different Clearly people like the product That sentiment is almost more important than the number Sales of the new models were nearly double those of the iPhone 5s 5 million in the first weekend after its launch a year ago and far surpassed the roughly 6 million that analysts had projected But forecasts for Apples latest iPhone had proven trickier than in the past because the company introduced two models simultaneously in 11 countries  including the crucial Chinese market Apple launched the iPhone 5 in just nine countries Another factor was that this time around Apple signed on NTT DoCoMo Japans largest mobile carrier China joined a rollout that included Hong Kong Singapore the United States Australia Japan Britain Canada Germany France and Puerto Rico Previously Apple began selling phones in China only months after the global launch We underscore one important caveat for investors Apples iPhone seasonality is likely to be exaggerated this cycle because of the addition of NTT DoCoMo and particularly because of the early launch in China said Bernstein Researchs Toni Sacconaghi who has an outperform rating on Apple Although upside exists for the September and December quarters the risk exists that the falloff in iPhone sales beginning in the March quarter could be more acute than history potentially resulting in some downside to estimates SUPPLY LIMITED Demand for the iPhone 5S has exceeded initial supply and many online orders are scheduled to be shipped in the coming weeks Apple said On Friday long lines formed outside stores in Tokyo New York San Francisco and other cities for the new topoftheline 5s and the lessexpensive 5c It was the first time Apple launched two iPhone models simultaneously The goldcolored version of the 5S which also comes in silver and gray was sold out as of Friday and will now ship only in October according to Apples website As of Monday the two other colors were also set to be shipped only in October Thanks to all our amazing customers for the fantastic weekend said Cook in his second tweet after he joined Twitter following a visit to Palo Alto Apple store last Friday Apple also said gross profit margin would come in near the top of a range of between 36 percent to 37 percent in line with average forecasts for 367 percent The more optimistic margin forecast should allay investor concerns that at just 100 less than the 5s the 5c will draw buyers away from the premium gadget Analysts average revenue forecast for the quarter stands at 361 billion according to Thomson Reuters IBES Apple which had grown notorious for providing conservative estimates that it routinely overshot had resolved to improve its guidance for investors Analysts have said the change will help rein in some overthetop financial expectations The company said more than 200 million iOS devices are now running iOS 7 mobile software rolled out just before the iPhone launch Apple did not break out separate sales figures for the 5S and 5C The 5C which starts at 199 with a contract offers a touch ID that scans a users fingerprint to unlock the phone The 5C starts at 99 and comes in five colors If Apple could ship so well without even having a larger screen iPhone which we think it could deliver next year then Apple is getting over a key hump Shebly Seyrafi an analyst with FBN Securities said in a note to clients We believe that the immediate availability of the phone in

810,Apple,10/15/2013,Apple bets on Burberry chief to burnish retail shine,1, SAN FRANCISCOLONDON  Reuters  Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts rebuilt the British luxury brand after excessive exposure of its trademark checkered pattern alienated wealthy clientele Her approach was to embrace digital innovation build a strong online business and tap Chinese and Latin American markets   Now Apple Inc is hoping she can do the same at the worlds most valuable technology company In hiring Ahrendts to direct strategy expansion and operation of Apples retail and online stores Chief Executive Tim Cook has set her the task of bolstering iPad and iPhone sales and returning some lustre to a brand that has not launched a major new device in almost four years One of her main challenges will be to boost Apples sales in China its secondlargest market Here analysts say Ahrendts will be able to draw on her Burberry experience of introducing less expensive goods without damaging the value of the brand The point of Apple retail is to sell Apple not to sell Apple products said Benedict Evans who covers mobile and digital media at Enders Analysis a research consultancy What theyve got is somebody who can take 400 stores with really great premium positioning and turn that into 800 stores and do that in China and do that in India and do that in Europe and in Russia and in South America and everywhere else which at the moment they dont really have Ahrendts is the first woman to join Apples executive team in nearly a decade and will take on an expanded role overseeing its vast network of stores that employs about 42400 people and online teams Apple has not disclosed how much she will be paid The head of the 157yearold Burberry Group Plc was Britains highestpaid CEO in the 20112012 financial year taking home 156 million pounds 25 million thanks in part to a large number of shares awards She took home 68 million pounds in the 201213 fiscal year Apples former retail chief Ron Johnson who had a brief and disastrous stint as CEO of JC Penney after leaving Apple in 2011 made 298 million in 2010 He is credited with building Apples retail network from scratch in his decadelong stint At Burberry Ahrendts began a website dedicated to the firms traditional trench coats and introduced webcast catwalks using the new iPhone 5S to shoot the springsummer 2014 show Ahrendts also collaborated with Google Inc for a brand campaign named Burberry Kisses But jumping to Apple  whose 157 billion net sales are nearly 50 times those of Burberry  is a challenge of a different proportion for Ahrendts The pressure is made all the more intense by Cooks previous stumble hiring a retail head from the British market John Browett CEO of British consumer electronics retailer Dixons was Cooks first major hire after he took over from Steve Jobs as CEO in 2011 But Browett left after just six months and later said he had not fitted in with the business culture at Cupertino Californiabased Apple Silicon Valleybased Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said not being steeped in the culture and looking at the space and the brand from an outsiders perspective might actually be a plus We are in a little bit of a bubble here in as far as what we think the consumers want and what they think of the brand EXPANSION CULTURE FIT KEY Apple is an engineering and designheavy company where executives such as design head Jony Ive exert enormous influence over strategy and products Successful executives from other companies have found it tough in the past to fit in a secretive culture that encourages competition between internal groups Unlike at Burberry Ahrendts will have to work with a smaller and more rigid gadget portfolio where every incremental change is agonized over It is unclear if she will have any say over the product landscape Ahrendts who rebuilt the aging Burberry brand will also have to counter threats from rivals like Samsung Electronics a firm that has often used tactics from Apples own branding playbook to compete Cook in an email to employees on Tuesday announcing the appointment described Ahrendts as wicked smart He said he knew he wanted to hire the 53yearold executive from Indiana after first meeting with her in January Weve gotten to know each other over the past several months and Ive left each conversation even more impressed he wrote in the email seen by Reuters She led Burberry through a period of phenomenal growth with a focus on brand culture core values and the power of positive energy Apples profit fell 22 percent in the June quarter as gross margins slid below 37 percent from 42 percent a year earlier and its shares down more than 30 percent since September 2012 are being pummeled by fears of slowing growth and competition from Samsung Electronics Apples retail growth in China has been slow and the demand for its products has spawned a bustling gray market In 2010 Apples thenretail chief Ron Johnson forecast the company would have 25 stores in China by 2012 It now has 8 stores despite Cooks assertion that China is crucial to growth By comparison Apple has 37 stores in Britain The company introduced a cheaper plastic iPhone last month to help make up ground in emerging markets to rivals like Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies Analysts said the phone  still more expensive than many of its rivals models  was not cheap enough The trick is to allow people to buy into the product and make it as mass market as possible because you want the volume and the sales but you dont want that to come at the expense of the cachet of the brand said Neil Saunders managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino Ahrendts is no stranger to Silicon Valley She is a frequent guest at Salesforcecom Incs

812,Apple,10/24/2013,Icahn raises stake in Apple criticized by PIMCO's Gross,1, Reuters  Bond King Bill Gross cochief investment officer of PIMCO butted heads on Thursday with billionaire investor Carl Icahn telling Icahn to leave Apple Inc alone after he again urged the iPhone maker to initiate a tender offer to buy back 150 billion of its shares   Icahn meanwhile revealed in a letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook made public on Thursday that he had increased his stake by about 22 percent to just over 47 million shares since dining privately with Cook in September  underscoring his belief that the stock is undervalued Later on Thursday he told CNBC that he is considering a proxy fight with Apple if the company rejects his proposal which calls for the company to purchase the shares at 525 each He added that he does not personally want a seat on Apples board at this time Apples shares ended regular trading on Thursday at 53191 up 13 percent The activist investor one of the best known managers in the 225 trillion hedge fund industry said he would test the waters with other shareholders and judge at that time whether to pursue a proxy battle Icahns demand for the 150 billion buyback repeated several times publicly and privately to Apples Cook since August spurred a caustic Twitter comment from Gross Icahn should leave Apple alone  spend more time like Bill Gates If Icahns so smart use it to help people not yourself In response Icahn told CNBC that Gross is entitled to his own opinion This is the business that he is in said Colin Gillis technology analyst at BGC Financial referring to Icahns latest move Whether that is in the best interest of Apple longterm remains to be seen Gillis however said Apple does have significant unused cash that should be spent either on operations and investment or returned to shareholders If you cant find a reason to deploy it then return it he added Apple declined to comment In a public letter dated Oct 23 but published on Icahns new investorfocused website on Thursday the famously outspoken activist repeated calls for deeppocketed Apple to use surplus cash to buy back shares He said a 150 billion move could ratchet shares to an alltime high of 1250 over three years Irrational undervaluation as dramatic as this is often a shortterm anomaly The timing for a larger buyback is still ripe but the opportunity will not last forever Icahn warned in his letter issued alongside the launch of his new website Shareholders Square Table While the boards actions to date  may seem like a large buyback it is simply not large enough given that Apple currently holds 147 billion of cash on its balance sheet and that it will generate 51 billion of earnings before interest and taxes based on Wall Street estimates Icahn in August jumpstarted discussion about the pace at which Apple is returning cash to shareholders when he tweeted he had taken a substantial position in the company He has since kept Twitter followers informed of efforts to meet with Cook He is expecting to talk to Cook again some time after Apple reports its financial results on Monday Mark Porterfield a spokesman for Pimco or Pacific Investment Management Co confirmed the Twitter message was posted by Gross on the firms Twitter stream PIMCO Read Icahns letter at  linkreuterscomqak24v   A TWIST Icahns new website the launch of which was plagued with early glitches that barred access seemed intended to further his goal of attacking underperforming corporate boards It carries a quote from Icahn himself on the home page from Texacos 1988 annual meeting A lot of people died fighting tyranny The least I can do is vote against it Analysts have said Icahns newfound interest in Apple is helping improve sentiment on the stock Icahn had argued as early as August that it could be worth 700 with a larger stock buyback program The company this week announced a new lineup of iPads for the holidays along with plans to offer Mac users free operating and work software for life Icahns latest proposal for Apple outlines a tender offer in which he himself will not participate In a tender offer a company offers to purchase some or all of its investors shares Though tender offers usually come at a premium to the current share price Icahn wants Apple to borrow money to make its offer at 525 per share or about 7 less than the stocks closing price on Thursday In the letter Icahn revealed he now owns 473 million shares of Apple stock up from a previous total of 4 million That means he owns nearly 25 billion worth of shares of the iPhone maker Apple is already in the process of spending 100 billion through 2015 on share buybacks as well as dividend payouts But Icahn says Apple should increase its share buyback program by the additional 150 billion Per my investment thesis commencing this buyback immediately would ultimately result in further stock appreciation of 140 percent for the shareholders who choose not to sell into the proposed tender offer Icahn said Furthermore to invalidate any possible criticism that I would not stand by this thesis in terms of its long term benefit to shareholders I hereby agree to withhold my shares from the proposed 150 billion tender offer Icahn said There is nothing short term about my intentions here Additional reporting by  Katya Wachtel  in New York and  Soham Chatterjee

821,Apple,11/18/2013,U.S. appeals court revives Apple bid for Samsung injunction,0, WASHINGTON  Reuters  A US appeals court on Monday breathed new life into Apples longrunning attempt to secure an injunction banning the sale of some devices made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ordering a California judge to reconsider imposing a permanent sales ban on some Samsung products   Apple which makes iPhones and iPads has been incensed by what it considers knockoffs of its devices by Android many of which are made by Samsung The two companies have been in a longrunning and global battle over patent infringement The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said on Monday that the lower court abused its discretion in denying Apples request for an injunction of Samsung devices for infringing utility patents and asked it to reconsider The US District Court for the Northern District of California had refused the injunction in December 2012 Apple Inc had requested it because of a ruling that Samsung products infringed on three design and three utility patents related to mobile devices The appeals court upheld the lower courts refusal to order an injunction on the design patents Last year Apple was awarded over 1 billion after it convinced a jury that Samsung copied various iPhone features In March US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose ruled that the jury had made errors in some calculations impacting about 400 million of the verdict Koh ordered a retrial of that portion of the original award which is now wrapping up in San Jose Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday Koh also rejected Apples request for a permanent ban on the sale of several Samsung products in the lucrative US market Courtordered injunctions are much more threatening to companies than monetary verdicts and tend to increase the likelihood of a settlement But in this case it could be months before Apple ultimately secures an injunction against Samsung which undercuts Apples leverage said Brian Love a professor at Santa Clara Law in Silicon Valley Still the ruling bodes well for Apples future court battles Love said The iPhone maker is scheduled for another trial against Samsung in April 2014 which involves newer Samsung products The Federal Circuits ruling on Monday will give Apple firmer precedent to get an injunction in that case he said Certainly this is not an acrossboard win for Apple Love said but I think Apple is happy with this outcome Samsung said it was pleased that the Federal Circuit upheld a ruling denying a permanent injunction for infringing Apples design patents The remand concerns a very narrow scope of evidence presented by Apple Therefore we are confident that an injunction will be avoided spokesman Adam Yates said in an emailed statement The three utility patents are for a bounceback feature which allows users scrolling through text to reach the end and then bounce back a multitouch display that allows the device to distinguish between a user who uses one finger to scroll and two to pinch to zoom and double tap to zoom which allows a user to tap a device twice so it will zoom in The appeals court said the district court erred in requiring Apple to show that the features in the infringed patents were the sole reason consumers bought Samsung devices Rather than show that a patent feature is the exclusive reason for consumer demand Apple must show some connection between the patented feature and demand for Samsung products the court said in its ruling The appeals court also said that the lower court relied too much on evidence that Apple licensed the patents to others as a reason to order financial damages rather than an injunction saying that Samsung was different because it was Apples primary competitor Samsung has the top spot in the global smartphone market with a 321 percent market share while Apple was second with 121 percent the research firm Gartner said last week Of the smartphones sold 819 percent run Googles mobile platform Android while 121 percent used Apples iOS Gartner said The district court abused its discretion by failing to properly analyze whether damages would adequately compensate Apple for Samsungs court emphasis infringement of these patents court emphasis the three judge panel said in its ruling Representatives for Apple did not respond to requests for comment The case at the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co Inc The case number is 20131129 Reporting by Diane Bartz and Dan Levine Editing by  Ros Krasny  Gerald E McCormick Andrew Hay  Andrea Ricci  and  David Gregorio ,74.998573,61.192856000000006
